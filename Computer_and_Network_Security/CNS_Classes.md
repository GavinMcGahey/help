## What is Git and how do we use it!

* Git is a version control system developed by Linux Torvolds to version control the Linux Kernel
* Git is a series of pointers that enable content (Blobs) to be managed. Learn [How Git Works]
* Three videos I have made may also help and I **suggest** watching if you are not comfortable: 
  * [Video 1] -- Git Basics
  * [Video 2] -- Push Pull GitHub
  * [Video 3] -- Merge and Fork

![Git Usage]



In its most basic form Git is a version control system initially developed by Linus Torvolds in 2005 to enable a distributed non-centralized way to track and manage changes to the Linux kernel. It is currenlyt at 87% market share according to [Wikipedia]

We will notice by watching [How Git Works] that git keeps your files organized by using a series of compressed files to keep track of files and versions by their SHA1 hash. It is important to note that one can version control anything on a computer, file, photo, music... But the most efficient method not to version control your Microsoft Word file, because it is wrapped in an XML warpper. It would be to store content as text, which we do in this class and will take about a little later. Think of storing code in text form and you are on the right track. You will find that Git can be used in a distributed form with GitHub or GitLab, both are hosted cloud instances that help you share, store and collaborate code. On these platforms it is not uncommon to store code as well as complied binaries depending.

We could spend the rest of the year studying Git guts but lets just watch this **suggested** video. [More Git Guts]

Watch the internals with:

```bash
mkdir fooproject
cd fooproject/
watch -n 1 -d find .
```


## Working with GitHub/GitLab

* GitHub will be used as a central repository for all class content
* GitHub can be used to version control any text content
* Class content is written in [Markdown] and rendered into documents with [Pandoc]
* Class content is "alive" and changes will be made often 



This course is going to be very different from other courses. You will genearlly not be told "how" to do something, only "what" we are trying to accomplish and sometimes you will be provided a method in which to do it. To that point I have attempted a unique method of managing the class by using a GitHub repository as the text bases for the class. Every class is written in [Markdown] which is:

`"a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by John Gruber with Aaron Swartz. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. [Markdown Wikipedia]`

That means that everything in the class is either text, including formatting, or a picture that is referenced with a link. Lets take a look at some examples, navigate to [https://github.com/macee/cns/blob/master/class_00_introduction/class_00.md]

You will notice that you see a folder structure that shows you are in `cns/clas_00_introduction/class_00.md` to the left of this folder you see that there is a "Branch" which shows you what branch you are on in the repositry tree:

![GitHub1]

You will be able to drop down the branch list to see all the branches used in this repository. A branch enables the tracking of changes without touching the main code base. For example, I like to keep the master branch clean until the course is finished and then merge all changes from that course into Master, for that reason we are going to use **2020F** for the year and semester (year 2020, F = Fall). **So if you seem lost remember to check your branch.** 

When you make make changes and the **Commit** them to the repository. An important concept to understand is that the **Repository** is the package of all the information of the product and currently can be **Cloned** from the **Remote** which in this case is GitHub and once cloned will live on your local machine.

Lets start with cloning a repository:


Working with GitHub to not only get the class content but also make your own adjustments to the content. Getting started is as easy as:

1) Setup an account at [GitHub]
2) Send your GitHub name to the instructor on Slack
3) Once you have access to the repo poke around using the navigation links under the black bar on the top of the screen. Move to the class of the day. You should notice a little pen icon in the upper corner of the file display window.
4) If you find an edit you want to make simply click the **pen icon** and you will enable editing. GitHub automagically creates a fork of the project for you in the background and when you are done it will ask you if you want to submit your edits in a pull request.
5) Submit your edits using the **Pull Requst** to send them to the instructor for review and possible inclusion into class!

## What is virtualization

* Creating something that is "virtual" vs "physical"
  * Virtual Compute Resources
  * Virtual Storage
  * Virtual Network Resources
* A host (or group of hosts) abstracts the resources allowing a pool of resources to be broken up into smaller groups
* The host is often called a **"Hypervisor"**


Back in the olden days we had one server for each... server. So if you needed a mail server you went to Dell and purchased a server that had the Ram CPU and Disk space needed for the sizing of your application. As you can imagine as your company matured you started to plan for sizing for the life of the server. So you really planned 5 years out based on some growth number you assumed based on some pie in the sky agressive growth plan. If you didn't, the sever would be too small and you would need to replace before the end of its life (usually 5 years). You normally purchased a server that was larger so you didn't get caught needing a new server. Imagine you do the same for your Domain Controller, Database Server, Web Server, ticketing system, etc etc. You had lots of servers, racks of server. Each would have some issue over the lifetime of service that involved power supplies, scheduled maintenance and upgrades and disk failure. When that happened that service went down. You would need to set up a whole different data center so in the event of a natural disaster you could keep running... More servers. More hardware. More maintenance. More Breakage.

In walk virtualization. The idea is not new, using a computer for more than one thing, dating back to the early days of the Berkley Sofwared Distribution and the MIT MAC (Multiple Acces Computer) Project. MIT needed the ability to use compute resources. GE won the bid to provide it but IBM took notice and created the CP-40 Mainframe which led to the CP-67 which was the first commercial Main Frame to support Virtualization. It ran CP/CMS (Control Program/Console Monitor System) to enable the utilization of a time shared computer. The system was tuned and released by 1972. At this point main frames did have other systems of time sharing but that invovled allocating resources which as you can imagine is not as efficient as **sharing** resources across environments, it also had the feature of allowing each tenant to have their own operating system and not need to share a system with someone else who could be doing something compleately differnt. In essance the hardware was running two things at the same time. The other approch was to have multiple users and seperate their usage in a multi user environment. This was what MAC at MIT worked on and called multiCS which later continued research at Bell Labs and became Unix. The CP differed because it was an entire sepearte operating system not user land. Unix took a differnt path however as opposed as virtualizaing the entire OS it focused on making software portable at the applcaition level and was the first to make application virtualization. The process contuied with Sun Microsystems project "Stealth" that later became Java. The idea being you write for Java and anything with the Java Runtime Environment can run that application. This made cross-platform protablility much easier. Java would create a "Java Pyte Code" that then was complied at run time on the end device. 

In 1987 a company called Insignia Solutions made a product called SoftPC that allowed MS-DOS Applications to run on UNIX workstaitons. They extended this by adding support for the MAC OS. This opened up for other vendors to make similar products. Apple made Virtual PC and sold it to Connectix. In 1998 a company called VMware was established and started making the VMware Workstation in 1999. Like the other offerings it was able to allow users in different systems on their system. As we will learn of all the companies VMware was the one that stuck and is one of the market leaders today along with a handfull of others. In 2001 VMware released the ESX Server that was a system designed to host Virtual Machines. Microsoft purchaed COnnectix in 2003 and released Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 and Microsoft Virtual Server 2005. Lastly Citrix purchased an open source project called Xen, started in 2003, and relased XenServer.


## Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors

* Type 1 is **"Bare Metal"** Hypervisor meaning it is installed directly on the physical machine
  * Limited other functionallity other than acting as a hypervisor - i.e. doesnt have the capability for normal dekstop functions like use a browser and send/receive emails.
  * Traditionally they are lightweight and optimized for performance
  * No traditional operating system or desktop
  * Some examples: VMware ESXi, Citrix Xen, Oracle KVM
* Type 2 is the **Desktop** Hypervisor meaning it is an application on your host operating system used to abstract the system resoucres
  * Also known as **"Hosted Hypervisor"**
  * Relies on the hosts Operating System to control various aspect of managing CPU and Memory
  * Some examples: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, KVM



There are two main types of Hypervisors. Type 1 is a lightweight operating system that is optimized for running on physical hardware and that alone also known as "Bare Metal". The most common version of this is ESXi which is made by VMware. You are use ESXi for free but in order to unlock the more advanced features you will need additional software. A Type 1 Hypervisor has little other function other than hosting virtual resources. It its core you do little else. ESXi has a limited GUI that enables networking and password options but most administartion is done in the web browser. The current system just transition to an HTML5 base off of the legacy Flash version. It is in this web interface that you can start and stop machines, make machines from an installer disk, allocate and adjust resources and many other tasks.

The second, Type 2, is a desktop hypervisor that is used to run another machine on your current operating system. This is a piece of software that sits on your operating system and utilizes native hardware access and the operating system to control the differnt aspects of managment of the virtual resoruces. In prior classes you have used VMware Workstat


 In addition to that, Bare metal hypervisors (type 1) are faster and more efficient as they do not need to go through the operating system and other layers that usually make hosted hypervisors slower. Type I hypervisors are also more secure than type II hypervisors.
Hosted hypervisors, on the other hand, are much easier to set up than bare metal hypervisors because you have an OS to work with. These are also compatible with a broad range of hardware.

### Visually Type 1 vs Type 2


![How Many Layers?](https://img.vembu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Hypervisor-Types.png)

## Why Bother Virtualizing

![So many resources](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/why_virtualize.png)

### So Many Benefits

* Increase hardware Utilization
* Share unused resources
* More resources
* Isolate hardware from OS - another layer of security 
* Move resouces accross different physical server
* Increase efficiency and productivity



When the world started to move to virtualization it was now possible to buy hardware for average load as opposed to peak load. I like to think of it like a water tower, in a water system you need be able to provide water pressure via pumps. If you don't have a water tower you need enough pumps for the max possible usage to maintain pressure. As you can imagine that max condition could only be for a moment and after the pump will no longer be needed. The water tower is built into the system to provide a means to provide pressure when demand is high and then replenish when the load is low. It enables the capacity of the pumps to be sized to average usage verus max usage. This is what the hypervisor does. It provides the ability to pool reasource so you have one pool that enables reduction of hardware and ability to build to what your system average load is. Many times not all CPUs will of VMs will be burning at the same time, not all memory will be 100% utilized. The hypervisor takes advantage of that!



#### So Many Benefits -- Desktop Edition

* Type 2 Hypervisors
  * Test out new stuff!
  * Run Linux as your host and still have Windows
  * Try out sketchy software



Type two hypervisors are for desktops. They enable you to have a host and run whatever guests you may want on them. There are various type 2 hypervisors. We will get some exposure to Virtualbox, and VMware Workstaion. If you have a Mac Workstation is called VMware Fusion and the free version is VMware Player. There are a few other Type 2 hypervisors but those are the major ones. You can use a vm to do lots of things. For example, I have some software for my boat engine from Evinrude. I didn't want to install it on my daily driver because it would be another thing and it was only for Windows (I normally use Linux). So I made a Windows VM and installed the software and was able to pass the USB port with the cable connected to the engine through directly to the VM and voila! It worked. Now that VM can live on a jump drive and work on any machine that has the Type 2 hybervisor on it. When I need to see what malware will do I use that same method to test something out, it is a great way to sandbox a machine. As a note, some malware is VM aware and will not run in a VM so you normally need to try to trick it in various ways, but that is for another day!

## Moving to the CLOUD

**The Cloud:** *A pool of resources of storage, compute, and memory available*

* As you span physical hosts you can span geographic datacenters
* Live migration and failover as well as geographic migration usher in an unprecidented era of avaliability



So what is The Cloud? We have had various clouds for some time. The idea of a cloud is just a pool of resources of storage, compute, and memory that is avaliable to you. Public clouds are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. Those major public clouds provide daily and hourly rates for various different resources priced by size and capablity. The public clouds have provided everything from Database as a Service to VMs and storage. We use the cloud in this class to host the content for the class in what is known as an S3 bucket (Super Simple Storage) which is a term from Amazon, the class content is actually in a smaller developer centeric cloud called Digital Ocean and they call the S3 Bucket "Spaces" but that is besides the point. The storage is one tool that provides an Application Programing Interfaces (API) to enable you to interact with the resouces in an automated fasion. This means you can spin up VMs and move them with a short bit of code. The tool we are going to use for this is called Terraform, and we will be installing it tomorrow!

In addition to public clouds we can also have Private Clouds, these are clouds you buy and own and they can be either remote or on premisis. An example of a local private cloud is the Cyber Net VMware cluster that Mr. Davis manages. It has a pool of resouces that we can use for class and labs and about as full featured as the above mentioned public clouds. The only difference is that it is completly housed in Mac Hall.

You can imagine that with public clouds you have the issue of storing information on someone elses computer. You get away from that with private clouds but you have another issue, what if your datacenter gets flooded, or burns down? In private clouds you need to take that into account and plan a Disaster Recover Site (DRS) which can be very costly. In a public cloud you can move machines around the world without much effort. This enables migrations to take place and systems to deliver content close to where customers are using them. Think of Netflix, does it make sense for me to stream a movie that is stored in California? It is much more cost effective to have a Content Distribution Network that is palced around the country to enable deliver to be close to the customer. Less bandwidth is less cost. 



## VM Migration

* Enables migration accross physical hosts in a datacenter (in VMware world called vMotion)

You can move memory to different servers. This means that VM's are able to be moved from machine to machine via memory snapshots.

![vMotion]



We talked about the ability to move machines from one physical host to another. This can be accomplished using various methods, on a private cloud it is called vMotion with the VMware vendor. Imagine you need to take a physical host down to replace a failed power supply or do routine maintenace. Without live migations and virtulaization you would need to turn off that system. In the world where having your service up makes you money this is not ideal. VMs can be migrated (while still running) from one host to another in order to enable service or move machines away from some natural disaster, like a hurricane. While working with the Navy my command needed to migrate machines from the Gulf area to the West Coast to avoid the damage that may occure from a hurricane. All without having any downtime. Take a moment to think about how powerful that is!



## Shared Storage

* Enables single pool of storage on the host (in VMware world calle vSAN)
* Or can mount external SAN or NAS

![vSAN]



We talked about pooling resources and storage is no different. Virtualization enables shared storage accross hosts. You can have your compute resources on one machine and your storage resouces on another. You can migrate just compute or just storage depending on what you want to accomplish. In the old days you could mount external Network Attached Storage (NAS) or Storage Area Network (SAN) to a single host that had a single service running. This was great because you didn't need to worry about storage failing in your server, you had redundance on your NAS or SAN. Now you can attach the same storage to a pool of resouces and decide what storage resources you need for what application. 

If you have a database that gets lots of random reads and writes you may want to have a pool of storage with Solid State Drives (SSD). If you have a ton of large files that are not accessed often you may to store that data on high capacity hard drives or tape. There are various ways you can streamline a system because you no longer need to have the storage on the same host as your VM.



## Virtual Desktop Infastructure

* VDI enables desktops to be established in the datacenter with little or no required hardware
* Desktop can be accessed from a Thin Client, Zero Client (PC over IP) or Browser (Blast Protocol)
* Enables presistant user storage without presistant VM (new session = new vm with same storage)
* Virtualize Applications only



As we move to more and more things virtualized you can have virtualized desktops. So imagine you no longer need a computer and you can get a computer with 100's of gigabytes of ram and terrabytes of harddrives. You have access on a small laptop to massive compute Graphics Cards (GPU) or 64 Core Central Processing Units (CPU). This is possible with VDI. VDI enables a small comptuer known as a Thin Client or Zero Client to control a desktop machine in the cloud. You can imagine it doesn't stop there. You are able to separate the user files applications and preferences out from the Operating System and apply those when the machine is started up so you are always starting from a known good base operating system. You can patch the "Gold Image" and set it to boot on all new machines next time they are started up. One may say "Well Mr. Macris what happens if I am off-line?" Great question Mr. Macris, some configuations enable you to synch your VDI instance with a physical laptop so you can travel, when you get back your files and preferencs are pulled and you are back to the cloud!



## One more... Containers

* Docker has enabled shared Host OS kernal and isolated applications and binaries
* Docker is a containerization platform which is a form of virtulization
* Other containerization platforms are BSD Jails

![Containers O My!]



One more abstraction on the same theme. Containers provide the ability to share the Host OS kernel but isolate the applications. This allows very low overhead because the base of the system is shared and only the differences are isolated. Containers can be run on VMs and can be moved across hosts very easily. A normal web application may have 6 containers consisting of things like storage, database, webserver, load balancer and firewall. As the world starts utilzing containers more and more it is clear the future is moving from Virtual Machines to containers. The leader in container technology is a company and open source project called Docker. Docker is the software that enables the sharing of the host OS kernel. As you start managing containers you need a platform to do that and that is where Kubernetes (K8S) comes in, that is a product made by Google and now managed by a non-profit. It is going to be the base of most clouds moving forward. VMware is even moving their entire vCenter and ESXi onto K8S with the next major release.

# Class 02 -- Intro 2 Linux
## Definitions

* GNU -- GNU is Not Unix
* Bash -- Bourne Again Shell
## Brief History

* Linux developed by Linus Torvalds
* Linux was first announced in 1991 and Linus has continued to lead development since
* The kernel needed supporting applications provided by GNU (GNU is Not Unix)
* Linux is free and open-source


Linux Torvolds started developing Linux as a project because he was sick of the licensing structure of MINIX (POSIX OS developed in 1987). So as an undergraduate he started writing his own replacement. In 1991 he started developing it and he released the first kerenl 1.0 in 1994 (We are currently at Kernel 5.8). The kernel, the core of the operating system, needed a number of applications around it, the Unix applications were alread being rewritten by an organization known as GNU (GNU is Not Unix). Linux is genearlly licensed under the somewhat permissive GNU GPL v2 and is free and open source. The Linux kernel is hosted at [kernel.org] where you can download and compile your own version as well as all additional information associated with it. You can also view the GitHub of Linux on [Linus' GitHub Page]. Take a look and the project and you can see how the creator of git (and Linux) intended it to be used. 



## Windows vs Linux

* Both systems are Desktop and Server multipurpose operating systems
* Systems are very similar but occupy very different parts of the market
* Windows owns the desktop and business enterprise
* Linux owns the web and supercomputer space
* Linux is generally free to use and pay for support
* Linux runs faster even with older hardware whereas windows are slower compared to Linux.



I am often asked what is the differenc between Linux and Windows. The answer is that they are both very different and very similar. They both have full featured Desktop and Server varients. They are both used by billions of people every day. You can do most tasks on either (some are better than others). Today, in reality, Microsoft has moved to make Windows more like Linux while trying to maintain all the things that has made Windows sucessful. Linux on the other hand is open source and community driven and rarly needs to incorperate any technology from Microsoft. Depending on how you look at it, Linux is really the most important piece of code the world has ever known. It is the largest project ever, it has the most active users, and it owns every corner of the technology market with the exception of the SMB and legacy corperate environments. Microsft is however very rich and working to buy their way into segements they are losing. Git, the program, is free and open source. So Microsft purchased GitHub. AWS is based on KVM (now Amazon Linux), Microsoft is pouring money into Azure and having only tempered sucess. Microsft had a phone OS that failed, Android is based on Linux and by far the most popular computing device the world has ever seen. The Coast Guard uses Windows, the world uses Linux. Both are impressive pieces of human enginuity, but born out of different beginnings. We use both operating systems in our class because the world is full of both! 




## Why Linux

* It is important to be familiar with both platforms
* Many tools are Linux only (Kali Linux)
* Some jobs are easier on Linux, others are easier on Windows
* Linux allows a user to control every aspect of the operating systems



Most of the security industry relies heavily on Linux tooks and custom OSes. From foreniscs to reverse engineering Linux by nature does not care about Windows permissions and because of the open nature of the OS it makes it easy to extend and develop tools used by both attackers and defenders. Also, it is assumed that most people have little if any experience with Linux but use Windows every day! As we will dive deeper into both Linux and Windows it was noted by students last year that a short primer would be very helpful. Mainly, we are going to try to get familar with how to use the command line and how build powerful commands and scripts that enable us to do things that are painful and repetitive by hand. We will learn a bit about regular expressions, and redirection as well as some of the best tools for different jobs. 



## What is the Windows of Linux

* The kernel is the lowest level of software in the operating system
* The kernel is responsible for linking hardware and software
* Distributions are tooling built on the kernel, tools like package manager
* Desktops are the Human Machine Interface that can be used to interact with the operating system 

Make sure to check out the [Interactive Distro Timeline]
I would also **recommend** looking at the [History of Linux]
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/brief-history-of-linux 



When you installed the WSL it doesn't look anything like the Graphical User Interface (GUI) you get in Windows. The core of Linus is the kernel that is responsible for communicating with hardware on your system. For example, if you have a webcam that will need to be supported by the kernel or have a kernel module loaded if it isn't. I just loaded a kernel module for a "virtual webcam" just the other day to facilitate software I am using for class to work with teams. The kernel is responble for connecting the hardware and software. From there you need various systems to start and stop service, manage windows and manage software (in our case "packages"). When all these parts are put together and the finish product is provided it is known as a **distribution** or distro for short. There are a few major ones that come from a few camps, we have been using Ubuntu which is based on **Debian** but the widly deployed distro in enterprise is from Red Hat known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or RHEL for short. RHEL is open source but the community version is called **CENTOS**. RHEL has a support model that makes it update repositories closed but CENTOS almost exactly the same, infact RHEL gives you a script that changes CENTOS to RHEL by simply changing the logos and the addresses of the repositories. Debian uses the **dpkg** based package manager and RHEL uses the **rpm** package manager, dependencies in Debian are managed by **APT** and by **yum** in REHL. The part you see and interact with known as the GUI are usually only preinstalled on Desktop versions of the OS. Server are usually don't have a Desktop because it is just extra software that is not needed. Desktops do range and you can select whatever desktop suits your needs. Many Linux Distros ust GNOME, KDE or XFCE just to name a few. The idea is that you have ultimate flexability on your system and how it works. You can make your desktop whatever you want it to be.

A Quick Stack from Bottom to top:

* Kernel
* Distro
* Desktop
* Applications


## The Terminal

* We will utilize a Terminal which is a text input/output environment
* Terminals need a shell which is the command interpreter, in our case the Bash Shell (Bourne Again Shell)
* The Bash Shell replaced the Bourne Shell
* There are other shells as well like the csh (C Shell) or FiSH (Friendly Interactive Shell)
* A console is a physical terminal- think keyboard, mouse and screen

For Linux the Fish (friendly interactive shell) works well. Install by typing "sudo apt install fish"
Fish is a Unix based shell that suggests different commands as you type based on what you have already typed into the command line. 

The Linux Bash Terminals are extremely powerful and can accomplish most major computing functions

## The Directory Structure

* Windows assigns drive letters like C:\ to each drive
* Linux assigns a "Special File" which is a block device to each drive
* In Linux you mount the drive to a directory

```


## More Directories

* You can use the `tree` command to look at directories in Linux
* The directory structure is generally the same across distributions (some slight differences)


```
constantine@pop-os:~/$ tree -d / -L 1
  /                     # root top level directory

 bin -> usr/bin      # Binairies mapped to user directory
 boot                # Files to boot system
 dev                 # Device files
 etc                 # Host configuation Files
 home                # User home directories
 lib -> usr/lib      # Share libraries and kernel modules
 media               # Mount point for external media
 mnt                 # Mount point for temporary filesystems
 opt                 # Add-on applications (like Slack)
 proc                # Virual filesystem documenting kernel and process status
 root                # Home directory for the root user
 sbin -> usr/sbin    # System binaries mapped to user directory
 srv                 # Data for services
 tmp                 # temporary files
 usr                 # Multi-User utilities and appliations (user settings and binaries)
 var                 # Variable Files
```


## Everything is a file

* Everything in Linux is a file or running process
* Files can be either
  * Ordinary/Regular Files
  * Special Files
  * Directories

## Special Files

* Special files can be either:
  * Block Files -- device files that provide access to system hardware `ls -l /dev | grep "^b"`
  * Character Files -- device files that provide **unbuffered** serial access to system hardware `ls -l /dev | grep "^c"`
  * Symbolic Link Files -- A reference to another file, like a shortcut `ls -l /dev | grep "^l"`
  * Pipe or Named Pipes -- Files that allow inter-process communication `ls -l /dev | grep "^p"`
  * Socket Files -- Sockets are files that enable inter-process communication `ls -l /dev | grep "^s"`

## Directories

* Directories are special files that can store regular files or special files
* `ls -l / | grep "^d"`
* One can make directories with `mkdir`
* One can change directories with `cd`
* One can remove empty directories with `rmdir`

# Class 03 -- Linux Basic

## Definitions

* SSH  -- Secure Shell
* OTP  -- One Time Password
* FQDN -- Fully Qualified Domain Name


## Linux Commands -- `man`

* Use the command `man` to get a manual page on any other program or command
* Navigate the page using the `j`, `k` keys (down, up)
* Search the manual with `/` (slash) followed by the **enter** key



The abaility to get help when learning Linux is paramount. To do this we know we have online search engines but that is *not efficient and tends to break you out of what you are working on to grab the mouse or touchpad. Instead you can find **manauls** build into the programs we use. The nice thing about the manuals is that they follow a pretty standard format. There are 8 main sections of the manual, some sections are not present or not used.

| Section |                            Description                           |
|:-------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1       | General commands                                                 |
| 2       | System calls                                                     |
| 3       | Library functions, covering in particular the C standard library |
| 4       | Special files (usually devices, those found in /dev) and drivers |
| 5       | File formats and conventions                                     |
| 6       | Games and screensavers                                           |
| 7       | Miscellanea                                                      |
| 8       | System administration commands and daemons                       |

You can access the man page for a command or program simply with `man <command>` which will bring you to the default **Section 1** or only section depending on what is present. If you want a particular section you can specify it with `man <section> <command>`. You can also simply show all man pages with `man -a <command>.

You can search within man pages with the `/` key which will enable you to seach for text in the body of the man page. If you don't want to enter the search again simply hit the `/` key without any search string and it will default to the last searched string. 

At this point you may wonder how do I get out of this gloruious font of knowledge? Use the `q` button to bring you back into your shell.



## Finding the right command

* Using the `apropos` command one can search man files
* You can get reminders or ideas of new commands
* This is a great resource if you forget a command or need a quick way to find new tools!



Many times it is difficut to remember the exact command you want to use. Going to the internet is again not always the best place to start so you can use built in tools to Linux to remind you of commands you know, or find new commands. For example if you want to find a command to "List Files" we already know that is `ls`. For a moment imagine you forgot the command, you could use the command `apropos list files` to help job your memory. If you do that you get a long list and the `ls` command is in there! What is cool is that you get a great view of differnt commands you never knew about that do simlar things. like `lsattr` which will list file attributes. You can pivot and read about attributes in a Miscellanea section page on attributes with `man attributes` or dig into lsattr with `man lsattr` if you think it will be useful for your work. Learning to navigate the man pages is important, like the VI editor you can navigate with the `j` and `k` keys to go down and up (the arrows also work). It may not seem natural at first but start to notice how many times your hands need to leave the keyboard for a mouse or arrow keys, it is minimized by using keyboard shortcuts and command keys!



## Installing

* Ubuntu uses the APT package manager
* Software is installed via repositories
* The package manager will assist in managing depedencies
* You need to elevate your privledges to install software (generally)
* `apt [OPTION] {command}`



If you have been playing around in any operating system you know that you will eventually need to install something. The way that Linux approaches this is very different from Windows. Windows issues a self contained binary you know as files with an "exe" extension. This generally brings you to a wizard that helps you install the software and all dependencies. Most of the time libraries for that dependency are incldued and compiled into the binary. Linux utlizes a different approach. The operating system has trusted repositories that it uses. These are public places where software for the system can be pulled from. You can add your own un-trusted repos but most of the tools you need can be obtained from the Distobution Repository. You can use your package manager to update software, install new software, upgrade your operating system, and much much more. The repostories can act as trusted software souces, and you can use remote repos or pull down the software you want and host one locally on your network. This is a very powerful concept for secure computing. The other benefit is that software can simply list dependencies, and the package manager will deconflict those depedencies. If you need a library for XYZ program, and you already have it, then the package manager will know that and not need to install it again. It will also check the repo for udpates and will update ALL that software and everything in the dependecy tree. Say goodbye to opening up software and having it need to get an update, the package manager does that for you.

You can check out the man page for `apt` and start to touch on its function, you will see varous associated programs like `apt-get` and `apt-cache`. We could do a whole class on just the apt package manager but know that you can use it to search with `sudo apt search <program>` or pull new software with `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`


## Navigating and Basics

* Find out where you are with `pwd` Print Working Directory
* Change directory with `cd` 
* List the programs in a directory with `ls`
* Print files to the screen with `cat` (also concatenates files) or `less` (more is less)
* Edit text with `nano`, `vi`, `vim` or `emacs` (nano is easiest)



To get started it is nice to know some basic commands. To move around a shell in a text based user interface it a few commands will be helpful. Using `pwd` to find out your current location is helpful. Everything is mounted to the root of the file system `/`. From here you will find directories and mount points. Many times your BASH shell will show you the current directory as part of your command prompt for example mine for the CNS repo is: `constantine@pop-os:~/repo/cns$` where it shows `<user>@<host>:<directory>$` When we look the directory we see a few strange things, the `~` (tilde) represent the user's (constantine) home directory (in this case it is /home/constantine). If I were to expand out the path that the command prompt is in it would looke like this:

```bash
constantine@pop-os:~/repo/cns$ pwd
/home/constantine/repo/cns
```

To go backwards from /home/constantine/repo/cns to /home/constantine/repo (go up one directory from cns to repo) you would use the short hand for moving up one directory in the tree which is `..` (two periods) where `.` (one period) represent the current directory, and `..` represent the parent directory. The command would be `cd ..`

```bash
constantine@pop-os:~/repo/cns$ pwd
/home/constantine/repo/cns
constantine@pop-os:~/repo/cns$ cd ..
constantine@pop-os:~/repo$ pwd
/home/constantine/repo
```

If we want to see what is in the directory we will be using a command we have seen before `ls`. Using `ls` will list the contents of the directory. In its more useful form `ls -al` will list files in long format (`-l`) including all hidden files (`-a`)
![ls -al](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/CapturedImage-16-08-2020%2014-52-08.png)
![ls -al](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/CapturedImage-16-08-2020%2014-52-00.png)

If we want to see the contents of some the files in a directory we can use the `cat` command. For example lets take the file `syllabus.md`

```bash
constantine@pop-os:~/repo/cns$ head syllabus.md 
---
title: "Syllabus"
subtitle: "Computer and Network Security"
author: "Constantine Macris"
date: "12JAN2020"
titlepage: true
titlepage-color: "2E3B86"
titlepage-text-color: "FFFFFF"
```
You will notice that it will list the text from the whole file (displayed above is only the first few lines)

If you don't want to show the whole document in the shell in line you can use the `less` command that will allow you to scroll through the pages with arrows or specific keys you can find in the help file using the key `h`. Check it out!!

If you want to specifically look at only the first n number of lines you can also check out the `head` command. As you can imagine the last few lines can be displayed with `tail`



## Make Directories, Copy, Move and Remove

* A folder is generally called a **directory** in Linux
* Make a directory with `mkdir` and remove an empty directory with `rmdir`
* You can copy files with the `cp` command. `cp <file to be copied> <destination>`
* If you want to move a file (it will no longer be at the source) use the `mv` command. `mv <file or directory source> <destination>`
* To remove a file you will use the `rm` command.



In Windows you move and copy files in the file explorer or file manager. In Linux you generally will not have a GUI (however the mechanics of moving and copying files in a GUI are pretty much the same as Windows). You will be using the shell and commands to move and copy files, make directories and otherwise manipulate files. As you can imagine a 2 year old can use most GUIs but it will take a little more time to master the shell commands. The first nuance is that **folders** are called **directories**. You can make directories with `mkdir` or remove directoires with `rmdir`. It is important to note that you can only remove an empty directory in this way. If you would like to remove a directory and its contents you will need to use the `rm -rf <directory name>` **Proceed with caution because Linux will let you delete your entire file system with this command if you issue the root directory as a path** That would be a bad day and the end of that system.

To copy and move files it is somewhat similar, you will using the `cp` command to copy and the `mv` command to move. Copy will make a copy of the file or directory at the source, move will move the entire thing and remove the source. You can get more information on all these commands with the `man` page for each. These command should become second nature. 

Like we said above, the remove command, `rm`, can really ruin your day. Linux will not stop you from removing yourself. But you can remove just about whatever you want with it. 



## Network

* There are various pieces of software that manage system networking
* Modern versions of Ubuntu use the `ip` command
* `ip` allows you to display and change network devices, interfces and tunnels
* Look at your IP address with `ip addr`
* `ip [OPTION] OBJECT {COMMAND | help}`


The `ip` commanad is an all purpose network command that helps accomplish many networking goals in Linux. At the most basic level it allow you to see what interfaces you have on your system and the IP addresses associated with them. It is, like most of the tools we are talking about, much more powerful. The command will let you set up static routes, manipulate network interfaces, manage and display IP Routing Tables and much much more!



## Remote Connections -- SSH

* SSH -- Secure Shell is a method for remote access to machines
* Provides a secure method for remote access
* Supports multiple authentication modes
  * Passworkd
  * Public/Private Keypair
  * Certificate
  * OTP
* `ssh <user>@<FQDN>`



A key aspect to working in this course is going to be getting comfortable moving from one machine to another. The most common way to remotely manage Windows machines is by using Remote Desktop Protocol (also supported by Linux) which is comparably heavy weight and insecure. Linux is majorly managed using SSH or Secure Shell. It is a remote access protocol on **port 22** by default that enables remote managment of systems in a LAN or accross a WAN. It is generally considered as secure as the types of encryption and ciphers used and because it is so lightweight it is fast and reliable. In the lab we set up Ansible that uses SSH as a standard means of access into a system. One can set up almost any authentication mechanism for SSH including LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), password, token, cert, OTP and many more! We will be using SSH so take a moment to become familiar with the command and the features!

## Introduction

![Depth](https://blog.knowbe4.com/hubfs/Defense_in_Depth.jpg)


Everyone knows we need security on our information systems. The biggest issue organizations have is where to start. In our first class, we will be exploring a few different government standards for information system security. The first thing we will look as is Defense in Depth. Defense in Depth is the idea that organizations should have layered security much like a historical castle. From there we will talk about the NIST 800-53, which is the security controls for federal systems. As you can imagine and much like exercise routines, there are literally of hundreds of security frameworks out there, including one that uses the same scale as your credit score... The most important aspect of security frameworks is that you adopt one for the right reasons. 


## Defense in Depth

* A best practice guide to security
* Defined by the NSA in a white paper. [Defense in Depth](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/nsa-defense-in-depth.pdf)
* Provides high level construct of layered defense model


Defense in Depth is security layering methodology developed by the National Security Agency. The idea is that by layering security controls and considering a holistic approach to security, you will cover your security bases. The method includes consideration of adversaries, balancing security of people, technology and principals


## Defense in Depth -- Castle

![defense](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/defense-in-depth-castle.jpg)

## Defense in Depth - Adversaries

* Who are your Adversaries?
* What are they trying to achieve?



When considering the attack surface of any system, it is important to consider who your adversary is. Closely coupled with this theory is how valuable those things you are protecting are. If you have a very expensive jewel in your home, you can expect that you will need to enhance your security posture to protect that highly valuable item. You would expect that the adversary will change from a casual thief to an individual who is targeting your home specifically because of that high value item. Normal locks are no longer adequate and you may consider getting a safe and a security system. If that jewel is worth $10 million, you would expect to spend a substantial sum of money to protect it. The more valuable the target, the more lengths individuals will go to steal it. Who wants what you have and why?
![](https://www.riskmanagementmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bae-the-usual-suspects.jpg)



## Defense in Depth - Adversaries (part 2)

* Adversaries include Nation States, Terrorists, Criminal Activists, Hackers or Corporate Competitors, etc.
* Motives include intelligence gathering, embarrassment, prestige, monotary gain, etc.
* Attacks include monitoring, active attacks, close-in attacks, exploitation of insider, supply chain attacks, denial of service (DOS), etc.


For data systems you can expect that adversaries include but are not limited to Nation States, Terrorists, Criminal Elements, Hackers and Corporate Competitors. As you can imagine the adversaries do not need to simply steal data. They can attack any aspect of the C-I-A (A-N) triad. There is a general misconception that one must have something of value to be a target, as described above. With automated scanning and exploitation it doesn't take anything to be a target other than being exposed. Many times the most valuable thing you have is not valuable to the adversary at all but to you. That is why ransomware has become such a problem for businesses in the last number of years. 


## Advanced Persistent Threats

* Usually well organized well funded (Advanced)
* Have objectives that continue across years (Persistent)
* Looking to harm target organizations (Threat)



Advanced Persistant Threats are highly organized highly technical "enterprises" that utiltize connectivity and technology to obtain tactical, operational and strategic objectives. APTs may be backed by nation states or criminal organizations. They are developing tools techniques and procedures (TTPs) as well as utilizing those avaliable to the public. We will go deep into APTs during our classes dealing with cyber threats but it is important to know that they exist and that they may be called under a number of names depending on who has discovered them. Take a moment to read about some APTs covered by FireEye at [FireEYE APT]. We will discuss mapping APTs using the MITR Att&ck matrix in the next class!



## Information Assurance

* Protection of Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication and Non-Repudiation
* Application based on **Protect, Detect, and React** paradigm
* IA requires a balance focus on People, Technology and Operations



The concept of information assurance is one that we link to "Cyber Security". The application of information assurance is in alignment with the cycle of protect, detect and react. The three relatively simple items combine to a continual improvement cycle which is the heart of any security program. In Defense in Depth Information assurance is the umbrella that attempts to balance people, technology and operations. When we apply these concepts together we get a basic security matrix that can call the defense in depth matrix.

|         | People | Technology | Operation |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Protect |        |            |           |
| Detect  |        |            |           |
| Respond |        |            |           |



## Information Assurance -- People

* Gain support from top down
* Develop policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities
* Assure continued training, skills development and accountability
* Includes physical and personnel security

It is a firm belief that personnel are the only tool that can solve security problems. Today there are hundreds if not thousands of "solutions" that will bombard security teams. When considering people as the core solution we realize it is not simply the ninja security engineer that is needed, but an entire security team. A top down approach requires support from the C-Suite or high level officials. Development of policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities will provide the people with the scaffolding to make good security programs. 


## Information Assurance -- Technology

* Assure the right technology is procured and deployed
* Assure adequate controls support acquisition
* Provide documented configuration guidance



We have talked about the solution bingo which shows overlapping solutions, solutions such as a service and lots of technology that leads to technology bloat. The simplest implementation that is the easiest to understand tends to be the most secure. It is important in the Defense in Depth construct to procure and deploy the correct technology. This often means that the tool may not be best in class as too many tools that are best in class will conflict with each other. What is often overlooked is the controls around acquisition of technology. One of the largest risks to the DOD is in the form of supply chain risk. It is important to note that in order to claim security during acquisition adequate controls must be established and enforced on the supply chain; in many cases these controls are the same as controls that apply to end systems. Lastly, when implementing technology it is pivotal to have documented configuration guidance. We will be learning about Secure Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) and Security Requirements Guides (SRG) which provide foundations for secure configurations. Additional documentation should be developed to adequately describe your system and allow the security team to fully understand the operational environment.



## Information Assurance -- Principals

* Defense in Multiple Places
* Layered Defense
* Robustness
* Deploy PKI and Key Management
* Deploy Intrusion Detection


Defense in Depth has a number of principals that are outlined as specific focus areas. Defense in multiple places means not to put all your eggs in one security basket. When considering a castle you have defenses at not only the main gate but also the side gate and the galley entrance, no matter how small always defend every entry! Coupled closely is to layer your defenses, have a gate within a gate in our castle example. Layering defenses is the core concept around Defense in Depth where if one defense fails or is flawed another can take its place. The controls should be robust and have a defined failure state that corresponds to what would be expected, fail safe or fail open depending on the application. A key to any security would be an efficient effective method of key management. Lastly, Depth shows its age by specifying intrusion detection which as become more commonplace in both government and industry.


## Information Assurance -- Operations

* Activities required to be conducted on a day to day basis
* Say what you do, Do what you say, Prove it
* Update your systems
* Protect -- Detect -- React (respond/recover)

![NIST Compliance](https://forescout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/How-to-Comply-with-the-5-Functions-of-the-Nist-Cybersecurity-Framework-300x179.png)


I have summarized the entire of operations to a simple ethos of "Say what you do, Do what you say, Prove it." In short you need to document what you do; this enables not just the security team but also an auditor to evaluate the controls you have in place on paper. Do what you say assumes that those controls you have documented are in place and configured to the specifications required. Lastly, prove it by keeping the records and enabling auditing to the level that any third party can come in and verify that the controls are not only being fulfilled but there is a documented trail to prove it. It is important to not just set it and forget but to make security a day-to-day rhythm where you do not simply continue the same process day after day and year after year but continually improve your process and controls so that the safest day you will ever have will be tomorrow. Coupled with this is the concept of continual upgrade cycles. A leading cause of breaches is due to openly vulnerable systems that simply have not been patched. Patch your systems. Lastly we end with the Protect--Detect--React; within the same framework this process is necessary in one form or another, by making it an operational cycle we add it into the toolkit that is our security program.

Provided here are a number of resources that will assist in familiarity with the Defense in Depth system. 


## NIST Framework

* [NIST RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/risk-management-framework-(RMF)-Overview)
* [NIST 800-76](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf)


NIST has created a number of frameworks as it relates to information assurance controls. If you search a term like "NIST Framework" one will likely find a link to the NIST CSF (Cyber Security Framework) V1.1. This Framework is one specifically designed for critical infrastructure and is a very good place to start and a great suggestion to make for an organization that wants to get started in adopting a cyber security framework. It is complete and free. In your career one will come across a number of standards to help frame a set of controls. For example, the Payment Card industry has combined to create the PCI-DSS which is by most counts the most highly adopted framework in industry based on the ubiquity of payment cards being used in business. ISO 27001/27002 is the ISO interpretation on controls and is again widely used. The Center for Internet Security has 20 controls making up the CISv7 which grew out of the SANS Top 20 Controls. The one we are going to focus on in this in this class is the NIST Special Publication 800-53r4. These are the "Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations". You will likely see and need to navigate these controls working in the government sector. We are going to use the 800-53 as the basis for the next few classes.


## NIST Families

* [NIST Control Families](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4)
* Individual controls grouped in C-I-A on Low-Moderate-High
* For example, a super secret system that doesn't need to be up would be High-High-Low (C-High, I-High, A-High)


The controls in the 800-53 document can be separate into Low-Moderate-High impact. For example lets look at IA-5 [Authentication Management](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/IA-5) we see that it shows the control, called the "Control Description." This will be the core of the control, in this control it is broken into 10 sub-parts (a-j). We see that for low impact systems we would use "Control Enhancements (1) and (11) which are seen below with additional supplemental guidance. In this case for a low impact system you would have IA-5(1)(a) to IA-5(1)(f) and IA-5(11) which would be an additional 7 Control Enhancements. Likewise you can notice Moderate Impact systems are (1),(2),(3) and (11) which is actually the same as High Impact Systems.

So what are the additional Control Enhancements for?

Additional Control Enhancements are ways to mitigate specific risks to a system. For example if you have a specific system that is developed and has some approved waivers for controls associated with authentication to make development more manageable (tokens or keys) control IA-5(5) may be used to mitigate this when delivery takes place. The focus of this system is to manage risk through understanding risk and providing reasonable mitigation to protect information systems and data.

## Introduction

* The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) publishes Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and Security Requirements Guides (SRGs)
* STIGs are specific controls used to configure software in a secure manner, a standard
* Security Requirements Guides (SRG) are more broad and give an overview of what a how to secure a class of items


Welcome to the world of security controls. When we ask, What makes a secure system? The answer in the DOD realm is "STIG it". A STIG is a set of specific controls that are used to make a system more secure, a security baseline. STIGs are specific controls for a specific produce and a specific version. General guidelines are known as SRGs and usually will be written for more general applications like "A Firewall" and has some detail outlining what a firewall should or shouldn't have configured but not how to accomplish that objective. A specific firewall may have a STIG associated with it but in the absence of a STIG an SGR can be adapted for different types of systems like network devices or firewalls. For example in the STIG/SRG files provided there is a STIG for the VMware NSX Distributed Firewall but an SRG for any firewall. That SRG could apply to the VMware NSX distributed Firewall but if the STIG is avaliable you should stick with that!


## Control Correlation Identifier (CCI)

* Serve as a:
  * Standard identifier
  * Description for actionable statements
* Bridge gap between policy documents and specific controls

The the following [Control to CCI mapping] to assist in understanding the progression



CCIs provide the ability to link policy documents and requirements, like the NIST 800-53 which we will talk about later, to actionable controls like STIGs. The CCI enables an overarching description of the "Control" that can then be applied to various applications which then become Vulns. CCIs tend to lack to details needed for a specific system but enable the SCAP to develop specific controls that can be later used and measured against. If you think about how one would **Correlate** a STIG control accross Operating systems, for example Windows10 to CentOS7, the CCI is how you would do it!



## Security Requirements Guides

* General Guidance for broad categories
* Provides a methodology for a type of technology
* Tend to be vendor agnostic


As with all things in the government SRGs are derived from a higher level guidance document. That document is the Control Correlation Identifiers (CCIs). The difference is that the SRG provies the control in the lens of the application it is working towards securing. Again take the Firewall we spoke about earlier. The CCI will inform all systems what to do, the SRG will put it in the lens of what to do for a Firewall and the STIG will be the specific settings for a specific piece of hardware. They are used to bridge the gap between CCIs and STIGs where STIGs are more specific and vendor/platform specific. 


## Security Technical Implementation Guide

* STIGs provide the specific process to enable an organization to configure a system.
* Fed from CCIs and SRGs, the STIG is a vendor specific document outlining controls to be implemented
* STIGs are generally viewed and manipulated either using spreadsheets or a program called the **STIG Viewer**
* STIG controls will be OS or software specific and usually provide specific instructions on how to fix and measure the finding


The STIGs provide a detailed controls on how to secure a system. The STIG controls are written in XML and can be viewed in a browser or some type of viewing tool like the STIG Viewer. The controls are broken into three Categories, Critical (1), Moderate (2), and Low (3). Generally, a "Fully STIGed" will have all the controls implemented but in a functional production environment, it is difficult or impossible to get all the controls in place and have systems still have an acceptable level of useability. The most secure computer is one that is never used, never turned on and stored in a 10 foot thick concrete box. That system is not very useful. Throughout this course we will be focusing on understanding controls and correlation those controls to the risk that it exposes a system to. As a general rule, all CAT 1 controls should be fulfilled, high risk CAT 2 controls should be addressed and POAM items should be made of the balance of CAT 2 controls and as many CAT 3 controls as possible should be implemented with mitigation and acceptance of risk for those that can not be implemented. Using a tool like the STIG Viewer you will get to make comments and assess controls. These tools are similar to those you will expect to see in the fleet, if not the exact same. The important items to remember is where the controls were obtained and endeavoring to understand the risk associated with the vulnerability the control is addressing. 


## SCAP Content

* The Secure Content Automation Protocol enables us not to manually assess and validate STIGS
* Includes various components
* Common terminology/dictionary(CVE,CPE,CCE)
* Measure of badness (CVSS)
* Common language to work on (OVAL, OCIL)



As with the STIG which is an XML list of specific controls that can be applied to a system, the Secure Content Automation Protocol is an automated process for scanning against standards. Not all STIG and controls are supported because you can only automate so many of the items. The remainder needs to be manually assessed, as we did in Lab 2. The benefit is that the time required to make the assessment is greatly reduced through automation. Please take a moment to reivew the SCAP document provided by NIST [SCAP Word Doc].



## SCAP Compliance Checker (SCC tool)

* SCAP is an automated method of *auto-magically* testing the security controls for various pieces of software or operating systems
* THe SCAP Compliance Checker is only on the NIPR Cyber Exchange
* The SCC supports various types of input and produces STIG Viewer Outputs
* The current version is 1.2 with 1.3 being developed and a 2.0 version posted
* The SCAP Compliance Checker (SCC) is a tool made by Naval Information Warfare Center and can be used for various operating systems



The SCAP content can be used to automate checking these standards. As with STIG Viewer the SCC tool is a good example of a program made by the US Government and used by the US Government. It will enable you to load SCAP content and run the automated tests against that content. The output can then become the basis for your STIG Viewer Checklist, we will see this during the full hardening lab (Lab 2). There are various tools that can accept the SCAP content but the SCC tool will be the one we use for assessment of Microsoft Windows.



## SCAP Scanner (Others)

* The SCC SCAP tool is not the only "approved version"
* [Validated SCAP Tools] range from OpenSCAP to NESSUS
* For the purpose of the course we will be using and learning about the SCC and OpenSCAP tool centered around Windows 10 and CENTos 7


There are a number of additional tools that are used for assessment of SCAP content. You willl see in the Validated SCAP Tools above all the industry tools avalible to you to use in the fleet/. 


## Putting it all together

* Lets Track down IA-5(1)(d) -- [Page F-95 of NIST 800-53]
* From the above linked matrix [Control to CCI mapping] we notice that we are left with a few CCI not specific to an operating system.
* Enter the CCIs into the STIG Viewer Program to get specific controls


There are so many controls and references it is difficult to get a handle on what is what. What we can do now is walk through a controls and identify a few ways we can find CCIs as well as specific Vuln ID numbers for a our IA-5 vulns. We will look specifically at the IA-5 (1) (d) control -- "Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];".

First, what does [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum] mean?

The control is designed to be flexible depending on the information system rules. It is expected that depending on the risk posture an information system owner will decide what an acceptable minimum password length as well as maximum password length should be. Many times we don't know what good values would be but luckily the STIG has some value identified as well as a method to configure it. In this case we would open the spreadsheet document: [Control to CCI mapping] and use the filter tool to filter on the "IA-5 (1) (d)" (note that the format on the spreadsheet includes spaces where the NIST PDF does not). That will give us about 8 controls:

| Item | CCI        | /cci_items/cci_item/definition                                                             | creator | index        | title                     |
|------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 794  | CCI-001616 | The organization defines minimum password lifetime restrictions.                           | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |
| 795  | CCI-001617 | The organization defines maximum password lifetime restrictions.                           | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53            |
| 795  | CCI-001617 | The organization defines maximum password lifetime restrictions.                           | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |
| 796  | CCI-001618 | The organization defines the number of generations for which password reuse is prohibited. | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53            |
| 826  | CCI-000198 | The information system enforces minimum password lifetime restrictions.                    | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53            |
| 826  | CCI-000198 | The information system enforces minimum password lifetime restrictions.                    | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |
| 827  | CCI-000199 | The information system enforces maximum password lifetime restrictions.                    | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53            |
| 827  | CCI-000199 | The information system enforces maximum password lifetime restrictions.                    | NIST    | IA-5 (1) (d) | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |

You can notice the spreadsheet gives us a variety of inputs from various publications. Some are rev 4 others are not, the controls are almost identical. Lets just look at the following CCIs:

| CCI        | /cci_items/cci_item/definition                                          | title                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| CCI-001616 | The organization defines minimum password lifetime restrictions.        | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |
| CCI-001617 | The organization defines maximum password lifetime restrictions.        | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |
| CCI-000198 | The information system enforces minimum password lifetime restrictions. | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |
| CCI-000199 | The information system enforces maximum password lifetime restrictions. | NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 |

We see there are four tasks broken into two groups:
1) Define Password lifetimes (Max and Min)
2) Enforce Password lifetimes (Max and Min)

We also have 4 CCI numbers associated: CCI-001616, CCI-001617, CCI-000198, CCI-000199

Next we will utilize a tool we used in lab called "STIG Viewer". You can open the program up and filter on some of these CCIs. We have previously loaded in the Windows 10 STIG and by using the "Filter Panel" in the bottom left of the windows we can filter for CCI in the control set. Here I enter each CCI as a filter and search by "Any" under "Must Match". By doing this we end up with **THREE** controls for the Windows 10 STIG.

* V-63371 -- Accounts must be configured to require password expiration.
* V-63419 -- The maximum password age must be configured to 60 days or less.
* V-63421 -- The minimum password age must be configured to at least 1 day.

We we also notice that these controls are technical controls that do not cover CCI-001617 and CCI-001616. How would we fulfill these controls?

What other information does the tool give you?

Why would this specific control be important?

# Class 06 MITRE Att&ck 

## Introduction

* Understanding adversary actions helps understand defense
* Moving from high level threat actions to tactics requires various models
* ATT&CK by MITRE is very much in the "Operational Level"



We have spent time so far looking at some of the tools we are going to use in class, some of the standards we are going to use to defend against attackers and we briefly talked about attackers last class when we looked at Defense in Depth. With that now we are going to dive a little deeper into some of those attacker TTP (Tactivs Techniques and Procedures) by touching on the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix and Navigator. This is a tool that enables us to tie high level attack models to actionable measurable indicators (be it an Indicator of Compromise or behavioral indicator).

* TTP -- Tactics Techniques and Procedures
* IOC -- Indicator of Compromise

## High Level

![Lockheed Martin Developed the Cyber Kill Chain]



The idea that we use models to help us understand what is happening in the world is common. Lockheed Martin developed the Cyber Kill Chain in order to help customers understand how one can break the chain and stop a cyber attack. As with most root cause analysis one can look back and piece together all the things that went wrong before a catastrophic event occurred. Suggested reading if you are interested includes [Root Cause Analysis for Beginners]. It is not a focus of this class but puts the Cyber Kill Chain into perspective, consider it purely optional. 

That being said, there is a series of events that typically occur for an attacker to successfully exploit a system. Many times the phases are combined but as a rule most of these items need to occur to execute a successful attack. The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain is an example of a High Level Threat model. In our case we need to understand understand that it is a high level model that feeds the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.



## What is MITRE

* A large (8425 employee) not-for-profit 
* Manages federally funded R&D centers for Federal Gov
* Organized into 7 Centers



MITRE is an American not-for-profit organization that obtains grants from the US Government to operate 7 research and development centers. One of those centers are focused on Cyber Security and for a long time MITRE has been working with security vendors, researchers, and security engineers to make a system that would enable us to understand attackers so we could better defend against them. This is starting to mature now and we are going to use it as a way to translate and combine a lot of cyber threat information into actionable indicators in our network.




## Pyramid of Pain

So why change?

![Pyramid of Pain]
[David Bianco's Pyramid of Pain]



The idea behind the ATT&CK matrix is that it is tracking things that are hard for adversaries to change. It is said that in old houses one step is made higher than the others and the home owner finds it second nature climbing the stairs daily. It is only when an intruder is in the home that the intruder is not accustomed to the one higher step and may trip alerting the owner. That may be an old Yankee myth but it illustrates how some things we do daily are so ingrained in who we are it is difficult to even notice we do them. In the cyber world these are Tactics Techniques and Procedures. For a more tech example lets take my `.bash_history`. If one was to look at my bash history they would find it filled with specific commands that I use every day to accomplish my goals. Those commands are not exactly what we are focusing on but more how we use them, take these two snippets of code doign the same thing:

Example A
```bash
cd /
ls
cd /var/
ls
cd www
ls
cd html
ls
sudo scp root@123.456.789:/var/www/html/file.html
```

Example B
```bash
ls /var/www/html
sudo curl -o /var/www/html/ http://123.456.789/file.html
```

We notice in both examples a file is being downloaded from a remote source and placed in the /var/www/html/ directory. You can also notice and they both use similar commands. How they accomplish that goal is very different. The top example shows someone poking about and walking through the directory. Example B shows someone who knows where they want to look, listing files and then pulling down the file they need using Curl.

If you see similar commands across systems you can start to learn how that person uses the system and thus start to see subtle finder prints in their work. The above example is exaggerated but think about how you could distinguish between these two individuals from a few lines of bash history.

You will find it is difficult to un-learn how to do things, you normally default to what you are most comfortable with!



## What is ATT&CK

* A method to organize TTPs into categories
* Helps track adversary actions
* Assists in identifying similarities



Check out the **suggested** [ATT&CK Whitepaper] about the design philosophy. We will be diving into how the ATT&CK matrix is put together for homework/lab this week. The aim of the tool is to lay out common tactics that attackers use in a rough order of how they use them and then list the techniques (and sub-techniques) for those tactics below. By doing this it helps provide a map of how adversaries accomplish their goals. 



## Phases of ATT&CK

* Broken into Tactics (12)
* Under teach tactic are various Techniques
* Inside the Techniques are Procedures (Actual APT observed actions)

# Class 07 Windows Hardening

## Introduction

* Operating system and application hardening is the first and last line of defense
* Consider the OSI Model when looking at holistic hardening of a system

* Consider both desktops, servers and appliances when hardening systems


Host hardening is what can be considered the first and last line of defense. As one can imagine end users represent the biggest risk to security on any network. Like we spoke about in Defense in Depth the approach should be layered accross the OSI model. When working with the endpoint you need to consider security at every level. From the desktop you consider the vectors that a user will be able to enable/access. For example, a user can only click a link that gets to them from someone else, how do people communicate, how would they get that link? Consider email, web browser, chat. How would an advesary get on your network, where does your internal network cabeling run? Is your data center locked? What will stop malicious activity, do you have AV/AM? Will the operating system keep enough logs to piece togehter what happened? Do you have auditing turned on?

As we have learned with the different standards we were introduced to there are best pratices that we should attempt to follow in this process. We need to consider each use case for machines and limit the system operation to that specicific usecase. A server should be limited in its operation to the services it offers. When additional services are coming from that system it should alert administrators. 


## Learning Outcome

* Describe for Windows (Desktop and Server), the steps necessary for hardening the OS with respect to DISA standards (OSH1)
* Describe for Windows Applications (Chrome, Adobe Reader), the necessary steps for hardening applications with respect for DISA standards
* Understand additional OS and Application hardening tools and standards
* Securely configure Windows (Desktop and Server), remove or shutdown unnecessary components and services, close unnecessary ports and ensure that all patches and updates are applied (OSH2)

* SCT  -- Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit


## Operating System Hardening

* A host is any machine on a network that is given an IP and communicates
* Host Hardening includes Hardware, Operating System and Software (think OSI model)
* A host can also reference the base machine that virtualization sits on or the specific machine (desktop)
* Technically virtual machines have and IP and can communicate on the network however they are normally seperated from "Hosts" by referencing them as "VMs"


For the purpose of this course we are talking about hardening the operating system, it can be assumed this also can extend to the applications as well as hardware (BIOS etc.) Many times it is important to remember the items in the technology stack. You may also hear OS hardening referred to ask host hardening where the host is implied to be the computer you are working on. The host is the discrete hardware unit. In the case of Hypervisor hosts, the host is the physical machine that make up the datacenter. The Virtual Machines (VMs) sit on top of the hosts thus the VMs have Operating Systems that can be hardened as well as the software specific to interacting with the Hybervisor (usually called "VM Tools"). Normal hardening procedures can be applied to the VM and there are usually hardening standards for the Hybervisor Host (the physical machine).


## Media Verification

* When downloading media it is important to verify the integrity of the file and servers it is coming from
* In Windows this is accomplished by downloading from official Microsoft Servers
* Another common way to verify media is to check the hash of the file


One of the most important parts of installing an OS is making sure that the system you installing is the intended compiled version the company, in this case Microsoft, intended. This is the **Integrity** of the file. Has the file be modified without the end user knowing. One way to tell this is to check the SSL Certificate on the website. The other way to verify integrity is to use the __file hash__. This method will use a one way cryptographic algorithem to verify that the file is exactly the same and that

## Microsoft Baseling Security Analyzer

* The MBSA is an example of a tool provided by the OS vendor to assist in configuring a secure system.
* System is useful for measuring patch compliance level for offline machines
* Mostly has been replaced with the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit


The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer is a tool made by Microsoft to assist in compliance checking based on patch level. The most basic aspect of OS hardening is to manage patches. In the event that you do not have access to Microsoft Update Servers or Microsoft System Center Configuation Manager (SCCM) servers this tool can give patch level management and an idea of the vulnerabilities the system has based on patch level. There are other methods to obtain this information like powershell scripts, but this tool is useful to have in your toolbox. When a system is offline it is not as easy to make sure what level of patching you are at. 


## Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit/Manager

* A set of tools for enterprise administrators
* Allows full security configuration baseline lifecycle
* Download--Analyze--Test--Edit--Store


The Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit and Manager is a suite of tools and reports avalible for current versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server (1909). The system enables you to, like the STIG and SCAP tools, to load baseline settings for various OS versions and services. These settings range from password complexitiy to update settings. With the hundreds of tailored settings you have the ability to create custom baselines that can be used in place or in conjunction with other tools and baselines.

## Ports Protocols and Services

* Limiting the functionality of the system enables reduction in attack vectors
* If a service is not running it can not be explited
* Use `netstat` to display active TCP conncations, ports on which the computer is listening as well as other useful network info


It is important to understand what services a computer has running. By limiting these programs you can more easily defend a system. This is a core concept in hardening a system. Expore the [netstat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/netstat) as a way to determine this information. Put together a `netstat` command to display your computer stats!


## Active Directory

* A directory service that keeps track of all the information in a network (Users, Computers, Printers, Security Principals)
* The main Active Directory service is the Domain Services (AD DS), which stores directory info and manages interactions of users with the domain.
* Most if not all Government Systems are based on Active Directory

# Class 08 -- Linux Hardening

## Introduction

* Similar to Microsoft Windows Hardening there are standards and tools for hardening *nix systems (Linux, Unix etc)
* You will notice differences in this process since, by its nature, Linux lends itself to automation
* Most Linux systems tend to be used for development or hosting of services so the desktop use-case is minimal


The SCAP content can be used to automate checking these standards but how can we actually mange compliance at scale. For Windows the approach would be to use Active Directory and Group Policy to push a standard policy to all systems. The downside to this is that one would need to usually import or build that group policy in the system and as described in **Lab 1** this ends up being a very manual process. This

When downloading media we remember how important it is to check the integrity of the file and server it is coming from. Take a moment to check an SSL/TLS Cert from a page you are downloading. Modern browsers have made is very easy to identify when something is not correct, using the cert you can track back the trust tree to the issuer of the cert and decide how much you trust them. Recall cert authorities can not always (and maybe should never) be trusted. A great reference for this is the [DigiNotar hack](https://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112/77170/) in 2011. Lets take a moment to check the hash on the RedHat image with the ISO checksum below (also called a digest): 

SHA-256 Checksum: 643e706cf7db9e93e706637af92d80eb58377dd0c64ac1e9ce6a72700aa04c2a

In order to test this checksum you need to use the following command:

## The Principle of Least Privilege

* The concept that anyone should only have the minimum level of privilege need to do job
* Why do nice cars have valet keys?
* This concept applied to individuals and servers


The idea of least privilege is a very simple one. One does not get more privileges then needed to do the function they are required to do. The issue with this is that most business are not capable of identifying the specific workflow that an employee needs to accomplish in a given year let alone day to day. For example, one would assume that an individual working in the finance department would need access to the web application for reporting daily returns. This user would simply need a web browser capable of accessing one website. This is very easy to lock down. Now we take into account that this individual needs email to communicate with peers and stakeholders. If this individual gets input from others they will most likely provide it via email, possibly as attachments. Other individual from an external partner will then create a spreadsheet to tabulate all the data needed for the reporting. To make life easier this spreadsheet has some macros that enable the spreadsheet to auto-magically make adjustments to the number and format pretty graphs.

As you can see we have gone from a simple system that is easy to lock down to a complex vendor locked system that enables one of the primary vectors for compromise in Microsoft Office Macros. For that reason security is as much a leadership effort as it is a technical effort. Leadership needs to have vision enough to rebuild the way individuals think of business to model it around the idea that information systems need to be only as functional as absolutely needed, no more. In life you usually get to choose two of three options:

Fast -- Good -- Cheap

You can't get all three. By being leadership you may have the opportunity to impart change in an organization where you can streamline process to keep the tool chain to a minimum. Simple things are always easier to defend. The fewer items in a tool chain the more time and effort you can spend securing each part, and proportionally, the less it will cost.


## Keep it simple

* Seems to be limited to the *nix community
* The less you understand the more difficult to protect
* If you don't know, you will give more than you should


Using the example above you can imagine how much easier it would be if the finance role was limited to simple input into a web browser. The moment we added email and attachments and proprietary technology "standards" we started adding complexity. Complexity is the enemy of security. Sadly we have come to expect functionally and the way we have created this functionality is with tools that are rarely the best at anything but can do just about anything, enter the office suite of software. Behind this movement we have then needed to make workflows around it, like email attachments and file shares and jump drives. All these things open doors to an attacker to take advantage of the most vulnerable part of your information system, your user. Think of your user like a newborn baby, they need to be protected and don't always understand what is best for them. They also very often know exactly what they want and know the best way to get it when they want it. The war with complexity will continue, living simply is one way to move forward and setting expectations to that end. 

* simplicity always will be more secure than complexity
* complexity is difficult to secure
* proprietary stacks allow convenience but limit control working in complexity



## Compartmentalize

* Don't put your eggs in one basket
* Segment systems where possible


Take a moment to look back to **Lab 1** where you added two users to your system. You have one user cred and one admin cred. Between the two creds you can imagine what each one is for. One for day to day tasks like email and web browsing. The other for administering systems. As can be imagined, it is not good to use one for the other. It is even better to segment the systems you use for administration. By having separate credentials and separate systems and networks that you can administer from you expand the principal of lease privilege beyond simple workstation configuration to the entire network. Should you be able to manage volumes on your storage server with your normal desktop? Should you be able to log into your virtualization environment from your cell phone? Separate out these tasks and make sure you have added logical and physical controls. This is the idea behind putting your web-servers in a DMZ of your network. 

You can continue the idea of compartmentalization to network [microsegmentation](https://www.darkreading.com/edge/theedge/a-beginners-guide-to-microsegmentation/b/d-id/1335849) and ending with the idea of ["Zero Trust Networks"](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/#researchPapers)


## Authentication

* How strong are passwords?
![Passwords](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/image.png)

<!--
The idea behind placing restrictions on password length is to increase the number of guesses a brute force attacker may have to make. As you add to the minimum password length, you dramatically increase the potential combinations and make a brute force attack more difficult. For instance, let’s assume that you only have passwords that are made up of lowercase letters in the alphabet. Here are the total number of password combinations for a few different password lengths:

* 4 characters: 456,976 combinations 
* 5 characters: 11.8 million combinations 
* 6 characters: 308.9 million combinations 
* 7 characters: 8 billion combinations 
* 8 characters: 200 billion combinations combinations 
* 12 characters: 95 quadrillion combinations 

As you can see, even increasing the minimum password length by one character dramatically increases the number of combinations. Based on this list, you might think that even a 6-character password might be good enough. But a brute force attacker who can do a million guesses per second could crack a 6-character password in 5 minutes or an 8-character password in 2.5 days—but it would take them 3,026 years to go through all of the combinations of a 12-character password. This, by the way, is why attackers are far more likely to use a

Password Complexity Another approach to make brute force attacks more difficult is imposing password complexity restrictions. This means that instead of just allowing any 8-character password, for instance, you require that the password contains both letters and at least one number, or a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters or even basic punctuation. By requiring extra classes of characters in a password, you increase the total number of combinations for a particular length of password. Let’s take the common 8-character password as an example. Here are the number of total password combinations for 8-character passwords with different password complexity requirements:

* All lowercase—26 characters: 200 billion combinations 
* Lowercase and uppercase—52 characters: 53 trillion combinations 
* Lowercase, uppercase, and numbers—62 characters: 218 trillion 
* Lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols—96 characters: 7.2 quadrillion

## Password Rotation

* Does it work?

## Password Rotation

* Attackers are Fast
* Rotated Passwords are guessable
* Foster bad habits



## Meet the passphrase

* How do you have high password entropy but still remember it?

## Lets get down to hardening

* We are going to explore automated hardening of CentOS
* We will be using Ansible Hardening


Lets get CentOS going with Vagrant, install Ansible and Git, clone the repo Ansible Hardening and put together a baseline config:

Start in Powershell

```powershell
mkdir class2
cd class2
vagrant init geerlingguy/centos7
vagrant up
```

Next lets ssh into the server still from vagrant in the powershell. This is a way to remote into a Linux Server from the command line, to the command line.

```powershell
vagrant ssh
```

The first thing we need to do is setup a key-pair to login to ourselves... yep we are running this locally

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

You will need to hit enter a few times, don't bother entering a password for the key. Next we will copy key to our trusted hosts file:

```bash
ssh-copy-id vagrant@localhost
```

You will need to accept that you are adding this computer your VM, to the accepted hosts to login to.

Now being in bash we will start installing the necessary software onto the system and clone the repository:

```bash
sudo yum install ansible git
git clone https://github.com/openstack/ansible-hardening.git
echo -e "---\n- name: Harden CentOS\n  hosts: all\n  become: yes\n  ignore_errors: yes\n  vars:\n    stig_version: rhel7\n  roles:\n    - role: ansible-hardening" > playbook.yml
echo -e "[local]\nlocalhost" > inventory
```

At this point we are ready to run the hardening automation but what are we running?  Lets take a look at all the parameters we can change, they can be found in the repo at [/defaults/main.yml](https://github.com/openstack/ansible-hardening/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

# Class 09 -- Firewall Configuration and Hardening

## Introduction



We are nearing the end of our STIG journey and moving from into the next module on networking. With that we have a rather light class discussing the STIG guidance and tooling around what we consider to be appliacnes and other devices. As you can imagine the endpoint is only one aspect of an entire environment. One could assume that when you purchased a network device it would come ready to configure and put into service. That is not the case. Like an operating system a firewall, IDS, or mobile device can have security baseline configuations applied to it like operating systems and applications. For that reason we are going to briefly talk about the types of things you can STIG that are not desktops or servers.

# Class 10 Network

## Introduction

Today we will be exploring the network layer. It is important to understand the network layer and how it fits into the OSI model as well as methods to secure the network layer. We will going into a somewhat technical deep dive into the network layer today as we explore areas of advanced routing like MPLS, quality of service (QoS), and Voice over IP (VoIP).

## Definitions

* ATM -- Asynchronous Transfer Mode
* VC -- Virtual Circuit
* VPI -- Virtual Path Identifier
* VCI -- Virtual Channel Identifier
* QoS -- Quality of Service
* MPLS -- [Multi-protocol Label Switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching)
* VoIP -- Voice over IP
* MAC Address -- Media Access Control Address
* NAT -- Network Address Translation
* Datagram -- basic transfer unit on patch-switching network, work on IP, also known as Packet
* Frame -- work on MAC address to transfer data (layer 2)
* ARP -- Address Resolution Protocol
* DHCP -- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

## Initial Questions

* Why do we need both the data link layer and network layer?
* What would be the issue with using just the data link layer?


If you consider how a switch works using MAC address you know that the switch keeps, in memory, a record of all the MAC address and which port they are connected to. In this manner the switch can provide the datagram to the desired destination. If you can imagine the switch needs to keep track where everything is on one subnet, the larger the subnet the noisier the switch trying to find what is attached where. There is a pretty good explanation here if you are having issues understanding why routing will be a good idea. It comes down to a few factors:

* Performance, security, cost
* Switch cost and performance: memory size and search time
* Broadcast storm: performance, security

By adding in routers we we can divide up the subnets and reduce the load on the switches and provide a more efficient way to address devices. With the concept of Network Address Translation (NAT) we have the ability to efficiently route between internal networks and external network. 


## The Network Layer

* Responsible for routing datagrams from sending to receiving hosts
* Source host encapsulates segments from transport layer into datagrams
* Destination host delivers segments to transport layer
* A router examines header fields in all IP datagrams (Packets) and forwards to another interface based on routing table


The main purpose of the network layer is to take link together subnets. Since inside a subnet the data link layer moves data around. Routing is the act of forwarding datagrams between subnets, routing is accomplished by software. The most popular network layer we use is the **Internet Protocol**  or IP. In the IP the datagram consists of a header and a payload, or data.  There are two version of IP used today, IPv4 with 32-bit addressing the second is IPv6 which was standardized in 1998 with 128-bit addressing. 


## Router Functions

* Routing
  * Generate and maintain Routing Table
  * Use Routing Algorithms: Routers working together to find routes between subnets
  * Distribute processing
  * Develop table of **all** routes
* Forwarding
  * Move packets from input port to output port



## Connection Oriented Networks

* Network backbone
* Very fast data connectivity
* Supports, Voice, Video and Data
* Used to support connections between two locations using ATM, MPLS or Network Backbone
* Every router on the path maintains state information for each connection
* Cells arrive in order

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is one of the first types of packet switching that is discussed. It is used in the backbone of networks and can support connection oriented networks. It is a method to set up a Virtual Circuit (VC) for fast data connection between two points. There are two types of VCs, Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVC). The main difference being the SVC needs to be reestablished every time data is going to be sent. PVC's are best used for connections between hosts but are mainly used in Frame Relay Modes.


## ATM Specifics

* No Packets... Cells
* Fixed length -- 53 bytes
* VPI -- Virtual Path Identifier
* VCI -- Virtual Channel Identifier


ATM will set up a virtual circuit similar to frame relay. Dedicated circuits are established for the connection. Each routing and translation table is then established to efficiently move cells through the network. In the example in **Figure 10.2** in the text shows a VPI/VCI of 2/4 which has a routing table entry for the incoming port of 7 to move the data to port 5. If that cell came in with 2/9 it would also be moved to port 5 but the VPI/VCI would change and the route may then go to a different destination. This is a method to have various VC's use the same ports on large high bandwidth system. This system is very different than the IP traffic we will be discussing that is connectionless forwarding.



## Connectionless Forwarding

* In an IP network only the destination IP address is needed
* No call setup required (no established path)
* Packets can take different paths and may not arrive in order
* Variable Length


The text uses IP datagram (packet) networks as an example of a connectionless network. Routing protocols dictate the routes that are formed in the tables but the routes will look at the IP addresses and route depending on those addresses. Those protocols include the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Boarder Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Open Shorter Path First (OSPF).
[example IP address](https://ipinfo.io/AS8167/200.215.0.0/18)


## IPv4 Header

* Data for this destination IP and order to reassemble held in the IPv4 header
* The header is typically 20 bytes in length
* Documented nicely (with links) in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4)

## IPv4 Header

![IPv4 Packet Header](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/ipv4_packet_header.jpg)

## Putting it all together

* Moving different size packets requires fragmentation and reassembly
* The normal max payload for IP packets is 1500 Bytes
* [Jumbo Frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo_frame) can carry up to 9000 bytes
* [Token Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring) can be 5000 bytes

## Types of Service/Quality of Service

* [ToS -- Types of Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_of_service)
* ToS byte marks the prioritization for special handling
* Byte includes IP Precedence (IPP)
* Later expanded to the Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP)


ToS is used to identify what type of service the IP Datagram is carrying because IP has no other way to assist in scheduling of the traffic. Some things like video and voice need to be prioritized over items like data transfers. With this in mind the IP header carries a Byte that contains the ToS. This includes the IP Precedence (IPP) which then became part of the more expanded Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP). From there routers can use types of **Queuing or Scheduling** methods to assure the packets with a high priority are delivered prior to those with a lower priority.


## Types of Queuing

* FIFO - First in First Out
* WFQ -- Weighted Fair Queuing
* LLQ -- Low Latency Queuing
* CBQFQ -- Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing


### First in First Out

FIFO -- It is typically experienced by everyone who purchases products in stores.  Each person stands in line and is processed in the order in which they arrive in line.  The size of the load and the urgency of the purchase have no impact.  This technique is the most common and simplest to implement.  Packets are transmitted in the order in which they are placed in the queue.  This scheduling approach works best in situations in which the ingress and egress ports are closely matched in speed.  However, FIFO is not recommended for time-sensitive traffic, such as voice.

* Most common and simplest to implement
* Packets are transmitted in the order they are placed in the queue
  * Works best in situations where the ingress and egress ports are similarly matched in speed
  * Not adequate for time sensitive traffic, such as voice

### Weighted Fair Queuing

WFQ -- It is the default queuing method on leased wide area network (WAN) interfaces with a speed of E1, i.e. 2.048 Mbps, or less.  It uses up to 256 conversation queues, one for each conversation or flow. Conversations are determined by a combination of the source/destination IP address, the ports involved, and the protocol type. Each flow or traffic class is assigned a weight based upon the IP Precedence.  It provides priority among unequally weighted flows, and prevents small volume, interactive traffic, such as Telnet, from being starved while processing high volume traffic, such as FTP.

* WFQ uses a number of individual queues, one for each flow or conversation
  * Up to 256 conversation queues
  * Conversations determined by hash of src/dest IP address, ports, protocol type, and IP Precedence value
* Each flow or traffic class is assigned weight based on IP Precedence
* Provides priority among unequally weighted flows
* Prevents small volume, interactive traffic such as Telnet from being starved out by high volume traffic such as FTP

### Low Latency Queuing

LLQ -- It uses a single priority queue for flows that are latency sensitive, e.g. the airline’s first class passengers.  It is used to guarantee specific types of traffic the bandwidth it needs.  The traffic placed in the priority queue will be serviced prior to any other traffic. All flows that do not match the priority queuing criteria will be serviced by WFQ.  This LLQ queuing criteria can be based upon protocol, IP Precedence, DiffServ markings or an access list.

* Used to guarantee that specific types of traffic receive as much of the bandwidth as needed
* Single priority queue (PQ) for flows that are latency sensitive
  * Analogy: first class passenger
  * Traffic placed in priority queue will be serviced before all other traffic
  * All flows not matching PQ criteria would be processed by WFQ
* Queue criteria can be based on protocol, IP Precedence/DiffServ markings, or traffic defined by an access-list

### Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing

CBWFQ -- It ensures that specific types of traffic receive as much of the bandwidth as they require.  Like LLQ, it uses a single priority queue to first serve the flows that are latency sensitive. It will employ up to four bandwidth queues that reserve interface bandwidth for other types of traffic, and these bandwidth queues are serviced after the priority queue.  Any traffic not contained in the priority queue or the bandwidth queues is serviced by WFQ.

* Used to guarantee that specific types of traffic receive as much of the bandwidth as needed
* Single priority queue which is serviced first for flows that are latency sensitive, as previously described with LLQ
* Up to four bandwidth queues that reserve interface bandwidth for other types of traffic
  * Bandwidth queues are serviced after the priority queue
  * Traffic not in the priority queue or the bandwidth queues is serviced by WFQ


## IPv4 Addresses

* IPv4 Addresses are a 32-bit identifier broken into 4 octets (0-255)
* [Addresses allotment](http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml)
* Each Interface generally has one IP Address and one MAC address
* Routers have a minimum of two interfaces
* Hosts normally have one interface
* Switches (Layer 2) have no interfaces

## Subnet

* Subnets are formed based on the **Subnet Mask**
* The subnet determines the address space of a flat network
* Each subnet will have at least one gateway interface (to get in or out)
* Subnet Mask designates the host portion of the IP address vs the subnet portion of the IP address

## 3 Subnets

![A network with 3 subnets](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/3_subnet.PNG)

## 8 Subnets

![A network with 8 subnets](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/4_router.PNG)

## Network Classes

* Identifies network address space into 5 classes by using the leading 4 bits
* Later replaced in 1993 with Classless Inter-Domain Routing in 1993 (CIDR)
* Class A-E where today we reference only A-C


* Class A -- Subnet Mask - 255.0.0.0 -- CIDR - /8
* Class B -- Subnet Mask - 255.255.0.0 -- CIDR - /16
* Class C -- Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0 -- CIDR - /24


## Private IP Ranges

* Dedicated private ranges are available
* These ranges are not routable on the internet
* Must be behind a NAT or isolated


There are three networks that are reserved for private use, known as [Private Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network). One for roughly each class.
* 10.0.0.0/8
* 172.16.0.0/12
* 192.168.0.0/16


## CIDR

* Eliminated the limitations of Classed Networks
* Address format is a.b.c.d/x where x is the # of bits in the subnet part
* Set "1" to all Subnet sections of binary IP and "0" to all host parts
* For example: 192.168.1.z (where x is the host IP space) would be 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000 making the subnet 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 or 255.255.255.0 which would be 24 "1"s or /24 in CIDR

## Supernetting

* One can combine multiple /24 networks together
* Referencing example 10.10 in the text we can combine three /24 networks to make a /22 network
* Recall that the CIDR is the **number of bits reserved for the subnet**


When considering the following subnets:

* 192.60.128.0/24   (11000000.00111100.10000000.00000000)  Class C subnet address
* 192.60.129.0/24   (11000000.00111100.10000001.00000000)  Class C subnet address
* 192.60.130.0/24   (11000000.00111100.10000010.00000000)  Class C subnet address
* 192.60.131.0/24   (11000000.00111100.10000011.00000000)  Class C subnet address

Note the number of bits that are no longer used for host IP addresses (where it stops changing). Count the number of bits from the left to that point. The count is 22 which relates directly to the subnet CIDR. To identify the subnet mask simply replace the subnet part of the binary address with "1"s and the host section with "0"s. To get the broadcast address simply replace the host section of the IP with "1"s. Remember that you use the IP part from before the subnet was calculated.


## ARP

* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map IP address to MAC address
* Hosts maintain an ARP Cache for items on the subnet


You can check your ARP for your machine by enter Powershell and using the command `arp -a`

This will show you all of the hosts on the subnet that your machines has cached. Now try to ping another machine on the network, you may need to have the machine you are trying to contact allow ping through the firewall. If you are able to accomplish a ping and the machine is on the same subnet you will find that you have added the machine to the ARP cache. 


## Limiting Subnet Size

* Remember each subnet needs a network ID address and a broadcast address
* If you wanted two hosts on a network to communicate how many addresses would you need?
* What would be the subnet mask and CIDR for that network if you are starting at a 192.168.1.0


If you have two hosts on a network you would need 4 addressed considering you have one for a network ID address and one for a broadcast address. One reason to do this is to minimize the chance that another machine could join the network. If you have the subnet set correctly you can only have two machines on that network. To do this we need to look at what we would need to calculate the subnet. With IPs of 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 we know we need only **two** bits to represent those four addresses.

* 00 -- Network   192.168.1.0
* 01 -- Host 1    192.168.1.1
* 10 -- Host 2    192.168.1.2
* 11 -- Broadcast 192.168.1.3

We know that the IP address is 32 bits so that makes the **CIDR /30** since we are only using 2 bits. If we replace all the subnet mast with "1"s we get a subnet mast of **255.255.255.252**.


## DHCP

* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
* Provides network info for a host dynamically (as opposed to statically)
* Allows hosts to join network without manual configuration


Hard-coded by hand to a computer
* Obtain IP address, subnet mask, Gateway IP address, and DNS IP address from ISP or network manager
* Type in a PC

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
* Dynamically get IP address from DHCP server
* “Plug-and-play”
* 4 pieces of information are provided by DHCP server
  * IP address
  * Subnet mask
  * Gateway IP addr
  * DNS IP addr

DHCP will allow host to dynamically obtain its IP address from DHCP server when joining network as well as reuse of IP addresses and support both wired and wireless devices joining the network. The device will only maintain the address as long as it is active.


## DHCP On Network

![DHCP client and server on network](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/DHCP.PNG)

## DHCP Request

![DHCP Request](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/DHCP2.PNG)


1) Host broadcasts “DHCP Discover” message
2) DHCP server responds with “DHCP offer” message
3) Host requests IP address: “DHCP request” message
4) DHCP server sends address: “DHCP ACK” message

Most DHCP servers are configured to let a client reuse a previously allocated network address. This can reduce the amount of broadcast traffic resulting from a DHCP DISCOVER message and a DHCP OFFER message. If a client remembers and wishes to reuse a previously allocated network address, a client may choose to omit the DHCP discover message. The client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message on its local subnet. The message includes the client's network address in the 'requested IP address' option. If the client used a 'client identifier' to obtain its address, the client must use the same 'client identifier' in the DHCPREQUEST message. **chaddr** may be used both as a hardware address for transmission of DHCP reply messages and as a client identifier. Servers with knowledge of the client's configuration parameters respond with a DHCPACK message to the client.

A relay agent is a small program that relays DHCP messages between clients and servers on different subnets. Routers connecting each subnet should comply with DHCP relay agent capabilities described in RFC 1542.

* BOOTP relay agents pass the message on to DHCP servers not on the same subnet. 
* When DHCP server receives the DHCPDISCOVER message, it processes and sends an IP address lease offer (DHCPOFFER) directly to the relay agent identified in the gateway IP address (GIADDR) field.
* The router then relays the address lease offer (DHCPOFFER) to the DHCP client using MAC (hardware) address

## Routing Protocol Overview

* Static
  * Configured manually -- Get from one place to another
* Dynamically
  * Utilize Routing Protocols to generate routing tables, update tables priodically, trigger updates when link changes


Gernerally, when we are talking about routing in class we are talking about **Interior Gateway Protocols** for what we have been calling "networks" or "domains" the text calls **Autonomous Systems** defined as is an independetly administered network. An **AS** would be like the USCGA EDU network or the EE CyberNet Network. Right now we will not be talking in depth about Iter-AS Routing (which would be between AS), which is primarly the **Boarder Gateway Protocol**. We will be discussing the two main open Interior Gateway Protocol, Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). These systems both work in differnt ways; one on UDP Port 520 and the other on its own [protocol number 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IP_protocol_numbers). The text discusses specific methods to configure these systems on Cisco routers however we will not dive deep into that aspect. But please keep note of this location in the event it needs to be referenced in the future.

## VLAN Routing

* SAME VLAN -- Routing within a VLAN is completed by the router relaying the packet as if it was on the same network
  * Machine A would make an ARP request for Machine B's MAC Address
  * Router realizes Machine B is on the same subnet and return **its own** MAC
  * Packet reaches the router and is relayed to Machine B

![Same VLAN](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/VLAN2.PNG)

## VLAN Routing

* DIFFERNT VLAN -- Routing between VLANs is accomplished by the router forwarding the packet to the default gateway
  * Once at the default gatway, the router will forward the packet according to the routing table
  * Packet will then be delivered to Machine B

![Differnt VLAN](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/VLAN3.PNG)

## Routing Algorithems Knowledge

* Global Topology
  * All routers have a complete topology and link cost
  * Link State (LS) algorithem in place
* Local Topology (Decentralized)
  * Knowledge of Link Cost for physically connected neighbors
  * Knowledge of routing tables of physically connected heighbors
  * Iterative and converging process of computation, exchange info with neighbors
  * Distance Vector (DV) algorithm



## OSPF

* Open Shortest Path First
* Open standard (RFC 1247 and RFC 2328)
* Interior gateway protocol
* Link State Protocol



## OSPF - Link State

* Uses the Link State Algorithm
* Complete topology map at each node
* Shortest Path First (SPF) computation using Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Three main steps
  * Become neighbors
  * Exchange DB information
  * Choose the best route - SPF


The idea of Open Shortest Path First is that each router will broadcast a message to other routers stating a description of all the router interfaces. This description includes the IP address, subnet mast, type of link (bandwidth) and other interfaces connected. All of this data will form a Link State Database (LSDB).


## OSPF

* Publish Link State Advertisment (LSA) disseminsated to entire area via flooding
  * Uses Protocol Type 89
  * Uses both Unicast and Multicast
* Multicast Addresses
  * 224.0.0.5 (all SPF/link state routers, also known as AllSPFRouters)
  * 224.0.0.6 (all Designated Routers, AllDRouters) are reserved for OSPF


When the router sends the message with interface information, called the Link State Advertisement (LSA) it does so without using TCP/IP. It is usign its own **Protocol Number 89** and will send these on unicast and multicast. This is designed to allow the routers to keep each other updated as to their state and provide the ability for the network to choose differnt routes depending on changes.


## Hierarchical OSPF

* Two-level hierarchy
  * Backbone: transit area, area 0
  * Regular areas: for routers connected to hosts -- Recommended < 50 routers/area
  * Link-state advertisements only inside one area -- To overcome the drawbacks of flooding and heavy computation
  * Each node has detailed area topology
  * Each node only knows direction (shortest path) to nodes in other areas
  * Smaller routing table to minimize cost and improve performance
* Area border routers: “summarize” distances  to nodes in its own area, and advertise to other area border routers
* Backbone routers: run OSPF routing in backbone area
* AS border routers: connect to other AS’s



## OSPF -- Build Database

* After the hello message and the excange of LSDB **each router calculates the shortest path tree** using The Shortest Path First(SPF) algorithm
* Once entry has aged the router will sent a Link State Update (LSU) to verify links are still active (30 min)

## OSPF -- ToS

* Link Cost can be adjusted to network characteristics like bandwidth, latency or monetary cost
* Standard "Cost" is **10^8/bandwidth**
* Allows multiple "same cost" path, **unlike RIP**
* Allows multple cost metrics
* ToS can be used when multiple cost metrics are used

## OSPF -- Dijkstra Algorithm

* Method used to determine shortest path
* Uses link cost to calculate routing table
* Walks through links to find shortest path


Using the Dijkstra Algorithm is how routers develop the table for the shortest route. A good summary of this [Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE). This method can be used for any path finding... Including mapping...

### Dijkstra in Python

For those inclined to code check it out in Python

```python
import sys
# Function to find out which of the unvisited node
# needs to be visited next
def to_be_visited():
  global visited_and_distance
  v = -10
  # Choosing the vertex with the minimum distance
  for index in range(number_of_vertices):
    if visited_and_distance[index][0] == 0 \
      and (v < 0 or visited_and_distance[index][1] <= \
      visited_and_distance[v][1]):
        v = index
  return v
# Creating the graph as an adjacency matrix
vertices = [[0, 1, 1, 0],
            [0, 0, 1, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1],
            [0, 0, 0, 0]]
edges =  [[0, 3, 4, 0],
          [0, 0, 0.5, 0],
          [0, 0, 0, 1],
          [0, 0, 0, 0]]
number_of_vertices = len(vertices[0])
# The first element of the lists inside visited_and_distance
# denotes if the vertex has been visited.
# The second element of the lists inside the visited_and_distance
# denotes the distance from the source.
visited_and_distance = [[0, 0], [0, sys.maxsize], \
[0,sys.maxsize], [0,sys.maxsize]]
for vertex in range(number_of_vertices):
  # Finding the next vertex to be visited.
  to_visit = to_be_visited()
  for neighbor_index in range(number_of_vertices):
    # Calculating the new distance for all unvisited neighbours
    # of the chosen vertex.
    if vertices[to_visit][neighbor_index] == 1 and \
     visited_and_distance[neighbor_index][0] == 0:
      new_distance = visited_and_distance[to_visit][1] \
      + edges[to_visit][neighbor_index]
      # Updating the distance of the neighbor if its current distance
      # is greater than the distance that has just been calculated
      if visited_and_distance[neighbor_index][1] > new_distance:
        visited_and_distance[neighbor_index][1] = new_distance
    # Visiting the vertex found earlier
    visited_and_distance[to_visit][0] = 1
i = 0
# Printing out the shortest distance from the source to each vertex
for distance in visited_and_distance:
  print("The shortest distance of ",chr(ord('a') + i),\
  " from the source vertex a is:",distance[1])
  i = i + 1
```

## Load-Sharing Multipath OSPF

* If there is a "tie" in cost OSPF can share the load accross the links
* When sharing load the packets may not arrive in order
* Utilizing multipath OSPF can improve latency and better utilize overall bandwidth

## Routing Information Protocol

* RIP is an older routing protocol originating from BSD-Unix in 1982
* Has two versions, RIP-1 and RIP-2
* RIP-1
  * No authentication
  * 15 Hop Limit
  * Don't use it
* RIP-2 (RFC 2453)
  * Optional authentication
  * Variable subnet mask (better to handle complex network)
  * Same 15 hop limit

| Speed of convergence                | RIP converges slower than OSPF. In large networks convergence gets to be in the order of minutes.

## References

* Wu/Irwin 14.1 - 14.12 -- This material is new and needs to be reviewed in entirety.

## Definitions

* TCP -- Transmission Control Protocol
* UDP -- User Datagram Protocol
* SCTP -- Stream Control Transmission Protocol
* DoS -- Denial of Service
* DCCP -- Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
* INS -- Initial Sequence Number
* RTT -- Round Trip Time
* ENC -- Explicit Congestion Notification

## Transport Layer Overview

* On sending host -- Breaks apart application data and sends to network layer
* On Receiving host -- Puts packets back together and sends them to application layer
* Various different protocols for different purposes
* Do we know what we use TCP, UDP and SCTP for?
* What are some other protocols we know?

## TCP

* TCP is defined by RFC 793, 1122, 1323, 2018, 2581
* TCP Features
  * Congestion Control
  * Flow Control
  * Connection Setup/Teardown
  * Error Recovery
  * Byte Order Preserved

## SCTP

* SCTP is defined by RFC 4960
* Originally developed for telephone switching systems
* All the benefits of TCP
* Additional provision:
  * Parallel delivery of multiple objects in a transaction
  * Improved security via DoS protection
  * Improved reliability through fail-over between host and redundant paths

## UDP

* UDP is defined by RFC 768
* It is a **best effort**, connectionless protocol with no order of messages
* Essentially "Fire and Forget"

## TCP vs SCTP

* Sending a HTTP webpage over TCP
  * Loss of segment requires retransmission, page wont display until received
  * Waits for serial transmission of missing segment, for image, whole page won't display
* Sending same page over SCTP
  * Multiple object sent in parallel
  * If error occurs on photo page will display and photo will display when it is retransmitted

## SCTP Sounds Great

* Why don't we use SCTP more?
* Short Answer... [Microsoft](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2222277/what-about-stream-control-transmission-protocol--sctp--.html)



## One more

* Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is defined by RFC 4340
* Carries many benefits over TCP
* Native Transport Layer Control, no need to implement in Application Layer
* Take a look at this [comparison chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer#Comparison_of_transport-layer_protocols)



## The Socket

* Allows communciation between two differnt processes on the same or differnt machine
* Packet will need to have a source and destination port number as well as a destiation IP Address
* A UDP socket only has destination IP where a TCP socket has a source and desitination socket
* UDP is identified by **two-tuple** socket
* TCP is identified by **4-tuple**


Lets try to set up a socket in linux:

We will be setting up a socket connection with NetCat `nc` on the Linux Command line. 
In this example, we will simply set up one terminal to listen with `-l` and one the other terminal to connect to it. The terminal that is listening is like a webserver, waiting lonely on the internet for someone to talk to it. The other terminal that connects will be you on your computer who wants to get some information from Google.

Server:

```bash
nv -l localhost 3000
```

Client:

```bash
nc localhost 3000
```

You cna notice that now you can type in one terminal and it will show up in the other terminal. You have established a connection over socket 3000. 


## User Datagram Protocol

* Connctionless
* No Handshake
  * No connection delay
  * No connection to maintain
* Small packet header overhead

## UDP Uses

* Media Streaming
* DNS
* Security (IPsec)



## UDP Packet

* 8 Byte header
* Error detected by checksum
* Application layer reassembles order

## TCP -- Lets get reliable

* What are the ways to mess up transmission?


In many cases error can be introduced into the transmission in a number of ways. Noise where a bit may be corrupt. Some data may simply be lost and not recieved. Other errors could be due to congestion. With all these challanges a protocol is needed to provide some control around the transmission of data and compensate for these issues.


## TCP -- Reliable Transport

* TCP is endpoint to endpoint involving a client and a server
* Uses checksum to detect corruption
* Uses ACK, sequence # and retransmission to account for reliability
* Flow control and congestion control used for loss/delay

## TCP -- The Handshake

* Reliability comes at a cost, establishing a connection
* Client "SYN" -- Lets chat here is my Initial Sequence Number (INS)
* Server "SYN ACK" -- Yea lets chat here is my INS
* Client "ACK" -- All set
* Sequence number allows tracking of bits transmitted
* Transfer of buffer size so we know how much data can be handled

![Handshake](https://www.mdpi.com/applsci/applsci-06-00358/article_deploy/html/images/applsci-06-00358-g001.png)


The idea of the handshake is that it is a method for establihsing a connection. It provides a place to start the converstation between two machines. One concept that sometimes escapes students is the idea of the sequence numbers and ACK number. Both of those are systems for tracking the bits that have been transmitted. Using the figure 14.9 from the text we see that the Client start with seq=1 and sens 835 bits. We would then expect the server to respond with an ACK "Hey I got you seq=1 and your 835 of data, I'll add them together and your ACK=836, by the way my seq=1 but I got no data. In this example the Google HTTP server will also send a response in addition to the receipt of the request. As you may note there is data assoicated with the response so the Client will be prompted for a reciept of the response in the same manner.


## TCP -- Closing Connection

* Similar to opening a 4 way handshake is used for closing
* Client "FIN" -- I want out
* Server "ACK" -- OK lets half close this
* Server "FIN" -- I want out too
* Client "ACK" -- Lets fully close this!
* And if the server never sends a FIN the connection will timeout on its own and close the connection

## Simple Acknowledgment vs Pipelined Protocol

* Imagine we need to wait for each response before sending another packet
* Ping macris.co to find how long a response from my git server takes (about 19 ms)
* Ping 197.248.116.74 (a DNS server in Kenya) and see how long it takes (about 250 ms)
* So to send 4 packages would take on second... an eternity in computer speak

## Piplined Protocol

* By using piplined protocol we send a bunch of packages and wait for the responses to arrive
* You send packaged based on the estimated Round Trip Time (RTT)
* The buffer becomes critical when sending piplined data
* Consider the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) being the size of data
* The number of packets, times the MSS must be less than the buffer N * MSS < Buffer

## Sliding Windows

* Once a package has been acknowledged the window moves
* May be better illustrated with a [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY3Sxvj8kZA)
* Or better yet.. with [error built in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk27yiITOvU)

## Explicit Congestion Notification

* In order to help congestion control a router can notify a host to throttle back
* This control is known as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
* Enabled in Server 2012 by default
* 3-way handshake can indicate support for ENC


### ENC Handshake

Characteristics of the 3-way handshake that indicates support for ECN in end hosts

| From   | To     | Packet  | Type                         | Details                                                              |
|--------|--------|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Client | Server | SYN     | ECN-Setup SYN Packet         | SYN packet with both ECE and CWR flags set                           |
| Client | Server | SYN     | Non-ENC-setup SYN Packet     | SYN packet with either an ECE or CWR flag not set                    |
| Server | Cient  | SYN-ACK | ECN-setup SYN-ACK packet     | SYN-ACK packet with an ECE flag set but no CWR flag set              |
| Server | Client | SYN-ACK | Non-ECN-setup SYN-ACK packet | SYN-ACK packet with any other configuration of the ECE and CWR Flags |

 The sender uses two bits in the ToS of the IP header to inform the involved routers that ENC is supported


## Round Trip Time Measurement

* Defined by RFC 1323
* May appear in any data or ACK segment by adding 10 bytes to the 20-byte TCP header

| Kind = 8 | 10 | TS Vlaue (TSval) | TS Echo Reply (TSecr) |
|----------|----|------------------|-----------------------|


Lets calculate a RTTM. If the sender sends a packet with a TSval = 31. The reciever echoes that it recieved TSval of 31. When the sender recieves the ACK response it marks the time at T = 38. Being told this is a Linux system where the timestamp clock is 10 ms.

That makes the calculation:

RTT = clock period * (response time - send time) ---- RTT = 10ms * (38 -31) = 7 ms

## Intro to Cyber

* Protecting Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA)
* Providing accurate Authentication, Accountability/Non-repudiation and Access Control.


When we talk about the basic CIA triad it is can not be overstated that the security engineer needs to have an inate understanding of these items. We add on Authentication which today invovles identifying that the user is infact the person who is authorized. This means using systems that can detect when this is not the case. For example, it is not acceptable to have an individual sign into a system even "With the users permission". Lastly, we need to verify that the events and actions can be linked back to a human user. With Accountability/Non-repudiation we strive to prove that individuals tracks are collected and verifiable. 


## Protecting all the layers

* Think about all the layers of security
* What aspects of each layer need protection?

![Protect the Stack](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/Screenshot%20from%202020-01-26%2016-25-36.png)


* Attacks to OS, applications, hardware, and network equipment vulnerabilities
  * Malware
  * Configuration weaknesses
  * Syntax and semantics weaknesses
  * Validation weaknesses
* Attacks to confidentiality
* Memory scraping
  * Eavesdropping
  * Packet sniffing
* Attacks on integrity
  * Modify content
* Attack on Authenticity
  * Identity theft
  * Password crack
  * Phishing attack
  * DNS attack
  * Cache poisoning
* Evasion on security equipment/measures
  * Mutated attacks
* Attacks on Availability
  * Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
* Social engineering


## Malware

* Malicious code often masquerades as part of useful software/message/information
* Malware exploits existing vulnerabilities on systems making quiet and easy entry
* Some malicious programs need host programs to hide their tracks
  * Trojan horses, spyware, viruses, and rootkits
* Others can exist and propagate independently
  * Worms, automated viruses and zombies



## Worms

* A standalone malware program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers
* One of the best examples is **Conflicker** [NY Times Article Looking Back](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/opinion/sunday/conficker-worm-ukraine.html)



## Phishing

* A method to attack human vector
* Normally through email but can be via other means
* Look around, we have all fallen for phishing
* Famously Robert Muller was phished in 2009 responding to fake bank request

## Trojan

* Software that enables remote access or a backdoor
* Kids are shortening the name to just Trojan
* Popular in Remote Access Trojans (RAT)
* RATs traded on internet (Never trust a webcam)


![RAT](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/download.jpeg)


## Botnets

* Network of systems capable of action when given instruction
* Control through Command and Control servers (C&C or C2)
* C2 servers are constantly changing and adapting


Botnets are contining to be an issue. The dated information in the book can be supplemented with the [2019 SpamHaus Botnet Report](https://www.deteque.com/app/uploads/2019/02/Spamhaus-Botnet-Threat-Report-2019.pdf). 


## Rootkit

* A number of low level trojans in a system with a focus on stealth
* Record user passwords

## User Mode Rootkits

* Hooking the user or application space in such a way that whenever an application makes a system call, the predetermined path of the system’s execution permits a Windows Rootkit to hijack the system call at many points along the path
* One of the most common user mode techniques is the in-memory modification of system DLLs

## Kernel Mode Rootkits

* As a system call’s execution path leaves user mode and enters kernel mode, it must pass through a gate that prevents the user mode code from accessing kernel mode space
  * Only the super-user or equivalent process can access the kernel
  * In older versions of Windows, this gate is accessed via interrupts while in newer versions of Windows this is done via model specific registers (MSRs)

## Master Boot Record (MBR) Rootkit

* Since a MBR rootkit, such as Mebroot, loads prior to anything else and is nearly invisible to security software, once the machine is infected, the hacker controlling the Rootkit has complete control of the victim’s machine
* Most MBR rootkits can defend itself by disabling all security related updates and patches as well as malware detection functions during PC boot process
* A more deeply embedded rookit is the BIOS Trojans

## Virus

* Self-replicating code attached to some other code
  * Biological virus
* Propagating itself and carries a payload
  * Carries code to make copies of itself
  * Modifies the OS or the application’s portable executable (PE) files
  * Needs to understand how some executables are executed in the operating system
  * To infect a particular program file, the virus will parse it, copy itself into the program and/or modify the header to get executed whenever the program is executed
* Performs some covert task

## Virus Phases

* Dormant: waiting for a trigger event
* Propagation: using exploits for replicating to other host
* Triggering: by event to execute payload
* Execution of payload
* Downloading files and/or executing programs

## CVE

* The CVE vulnerability naming scheme is for a dictionary of unique, common names for publicly known software flaws
* The MITRE Corporation assigns CVE IDs to publicly known vulnerabilities in commercial and open source software
* General information on CVE is available at [http://cve.mitre.org/](http://cve.mitre.org/)

## CVE info

* A comprehensive list of publicly known software flaws
* A globally unique name to identify each vulnerability
* A basis for discussing both the priorities and risks of vulnerabilities
* A way for a user of disparate products and services to integrate vulnerability information

## Common Configuration Enumeration

* The CCE version 5 List provides unique identifiers for software security configuration settings  
* The settings are recommendations for securing an OS or application
* The MITRE Corporation maintains and publishes the lists of CCE names. The lists, and additional information on CCE, are available at [http://cce.mitre.org/](http://cce.mitre.org/)

## Obfuscation

* Obfuscation techniques are used by malware to avoid detection and analysis
  * Polymorphism: changing the encryption/decryption routine
    * The malware employs a very large pool of encryption/decryption routines and are much harder to detect using signatures.
    * This high number of encryption/decryption routines is delivered through the use of a mutation engine
  * Metamorphism: changing the virus body but performing the same task
    * Using equivalent functions (or code)
    * Changing the sequence of codes
    * Inserting unneeded functions (or code)
    * Malware Mutation includes polymorphism and metamorphism
  * Entry point obfuscation (EPO)
* The malware can use multiple obfuscation techniques and fragmented call routines to make detection very difficult


## Executable Packing/Compression

* Executable packing/compression is also frequently used to deter reverse engineering or to obfuscate the contents of the executable
  * A software vendor wants to protect their code from reverse engineering, while hackers want to hide the presence of malware from anti-malware scanners through the use of proprietary packing methods and/or added encryption
  * Executable packing can be used to prevent direct disassembly, mask string literals and modified signatures
  * Although this does not eliminate the chance for reverse engineering and debugging analysis, it can make the process more difficult and costly
* An executable packer compresses an executable file and combines the compressed data with the decompression code it needs into a single executable

## Executable Packing Process

* Executing a packed executable transfers control to it
* Executes the decompression code
* Unpacks the original executable code
* Then runs the unpacked code

## Executable Packign Tooling

* UPX supports Windows Protable Executable (PE) file format, DOS executables, and the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

## Windows PE file

* PE file is similar to what the module would look like after Windows has loaded it=
* The Windows loader does not need to work extremely hard to create a process from the disk file
* The loader uses the memory-mapped file mechanism to map the appropriate pieces of the file into the virtual address space
* Relative Virtual Address (RVA). Many fields in PE files are specified in terms of RVAs. An RVA is simply the offset of another item, relative to where the file is memory-mapped.

## Windows PE Format

![PE Structure](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/PE.png)



## Entry Point Obfuscation (EPO)

This type of malware changes a random location in the host file data instead of changing the headers (PE headers in Windows) or the initial host file data, so that the entry point of the malware is hidden in the host file

* Call hooking: Using a function call routine to get itself executed: aka call hooking
  * The malware first scans the targeted program code (in .text area of PE) for any function or subroutine calls or for certain APIs -- For example, a relocation table in a PE can be modified to direct control to malware code
  * It then changes one of the subroutine calls to gain execution control and passes the control to the actual subroutine after execution  
* Call inserting: Inserting a subroutine call into the host program code
  * The control is transferred to the malware via an inserted subroutine call that is embedded in the host program code
  * After the execution is complete, the control is transferred back to the host program

## EPO detection difficulty

* Embedding the call/jump into the malware code deep within a target executable prevents tracing the execution path of an EPO-infected file and provides no guarantee that the virus code itself will ever be called
* The EPO disables the static detection method of malware, as it removes the ability for a scanner to trace into the virus code with any guarantee
* In other words, the scanner is unable to detect its exact location in order to emulate it
* It is also very difficult to clean up an infected host due to the modifications to host programs performed by malware

# Class 14 Firewalls
## Definitions

* ACL -- Access Control List
* NGAV -- Next Generation Anti Virus
## References

* Wu/Irwin 18.1 - 18.4
* Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling The Wily Hacker -- Bellovin and Cheswick

## Firewalls overview

* Separate trusted areas of network
* Seperate trusted and untrusted areas of network
* Separates different parts of network (user and management)
* Host based to protect OS


Firewalls come in many forms. The most basic is your modem/router/switch/access point/firewall (that box the cable company gives you). This is the way you keep your machine separated from the rest of the world. You are currently behind the EDU network firewalls. In the most basic setup the gateway router is also your firewall. As you can imagine these configurations get more complicated very quickly. One can also have a firewall on their host machine; this would be a Host Based Firewall.


## Three Main Requirement

* All Traffic between two different trust zones must pass throug the firewall
* Only authorized traffic should be allowed to pass throug the firewall
* The firewall must be immune to penetration 



As Wenliang Du points out in his book *Computer and Internet Security, A Hands-on Approach* and was earlier presentd by Bellovin and Cheswick in *Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling The Wily Hacker* that a functional firewall needs to have the following attributes:

1) All Traffic between two different trust zones must pass throug the firewall
2) Only authorized traffic should be allowed to pass throug the firewall
3) The firewall must be immune to penetration



## In and Out

* Ingress -- Filtering data coming in
* Egress  -- Filtering data going out

## The Security Gateway

* Firewall
* Proxy Filter
* Network Address Translation
* Virtual Private Network
* Anti Virus
* Anti Spam
* URL Filtering
* Intrusion Detection/ Intrusion Prevention

Just like your home "router" is really a router, switch, NAT, firewall and access point. The industry is moving toward the idea of a Unified Security Gateway for many applications. This rolls a number of features into one virtual or physical appliance. As you see above a firewall is not longer all that is included. These systems provide proxy services, NAT, VPN, Anti Virus, Anti Spam, URL Filtering and IDS/IPS. Some of the vendors that provide these "all in one" products are Cisco, Fortigate, Palo Alto Networks, Sophos, Watchguard and Meraki. Host-based firewalls and IDS include products like AVS, Sophos, Fortigate, and Carbon Black. The line is starting to blur between what is a Next-Generation Anti Virus (NGAV) and a traditional host-based firewall. That being said you also need to consider the fact that we now have cloud services to consider and the features and benefits of firewalls through cloud providers, like Azure or Google Cloud, as well as the aftermarket cloud firewalls from vendors like Palo Alto Networks. One notable last type of firewall would be a Web Application Firewall (WAF). These services are hosted by companies like Impervia and Cloudflare and provide websites protection from attacks. 


## Types of Firewalls

* Packet Filtering
  * Stateful
  * Stateless
* Proxy Server
* Host Firewall
* Application Firewall

## Stateless Packet Filtering

* Firewall decides if packet moves forwarded
* Per packet basis
* Based on header info


In a stateless packet filtering firewall, the firewall is looking at packets and packet headers... Every packet header. We all know what it's finding in that information right? It is finding IP source and destination. Protocol, like TCP, UDP, ICMP and any flags associated with those protocol. With this information the firewall can make decisions. It can block all IPs from a certain place. Or block destination IPs. Same thing if you want to block a particular protocol. Imagine, if it knows about it, it can be blocked. These rules will be combined to make what most vendors refer to as an Access Control List (ACL). In the example of the text (18.2) we can control traffic from the Finance server to the accounting group as well as from the Web Server to the internet. It specifies that it will accept any port greater than (gt) 1024 and allow connection to 443 for the Finance Web Server and 80 for the Public Web server.

![Packet Filtering FTW](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/Screenshot%20from%202020-01-29%2017-11-27.png)


## Inbound and Outbound Packet Filtering

* Packets can be filtered coming in or going out (inbound or outbound)
* What do you think is more common?
* When would you filter incoming?
* When would you filter outgoing?

## Access Control List

* ACLs are a sequential list of permit and deny conditions
* All stateful header info can be filtered
* Order matters, once a match is found it stops checking
* What should be the last rule?
* Where should high probability rules be?



## Why isn't everything a Stateless Packet Filtering Firewall

* No context of the payload, could be application attacks
* No authentication only IP address


The stateless packet filter firewall has an application in being able to set out simple rules to help control the flow of packets around the network. As we saw in the above example you can very easily limit the flow of information to and from servers. There are, however, some drawbacks. I have often heard that "we need to block these countries because that is where the attackers are". This is something a stateless packet filtering firewall can absolutely do. Block all addresses from England or Greece... No problem, the only issue is the Greek hacker knows that no one trusts the Greeks and thus spends $5/month (or 45000 Drachma an hour) on a virtual private server in Chicago to launch her attack from. Additionally, if the attacker was an application layer attack like a Cross Site Scripting or buffer overflow you can imagine that the Stateless Packet Fileting system would not work well. So we can see the uses and drawbacks to this type of firewall. Next class we will go over stateful packet filtering, application firewalls and proxy firewalls. 

# Class 15 Firewalls
## Definitions

* SOCKS -- Sockets Circuit Level Gateway
* NIC -- Network Interface Card
* LKM -- Loadable Kernel Modules
## References

* Wu/Irwin 18.4 - 18.14

## TCP Flags

* Stateless Packet Filters can allow a TCP connection from outside in
* But can block a TCP connection from inside out
* Allowing the SYN ACK packets to return but blocking an external SYN packet


Before we move onto stateful packet inspection it is important to note that it is not all external packets that are blocked by a firewall using stateless inspection. Imagine you send a SYN packet out to establish a TCP connection. If you blocked all external packets you would never be able to establish a connection. So the firewall needs to allow SYN ACK packages. This is accomplished by the firewall keeping track of TCP flags. This enables the firewall to block all outside SYN packets to protect an external entity establishing a connection into the network.


## Types of Firewalls

| Type              | Security | Computation | UDP/ICMP Capability   |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Stateless Filter  | 3        | 1           | Yes                   |
| Stateful Filter   | 2        | 2           | Yes                   |
| Circuit-Level     | 2        | 3           | Yes (SOCKS v5)        |
| Application-Level | 1        | 4           | Application Dependent |

## Stateful Packet Inspection

* Monitors sessions (tracks packets across a session)
* Low overhead and high throughput
* The filtering rules (ACL) has the same format as stateless filtering

## Network Address Translation

* Firewalls/NAT devices provide Network Address Translation (NAT) to exchange private IPs and ports
* Keeps track of table of connections and translations in NAT Translation Table

## Application-Level Gateway

* Proxy Filters are an example of an Application-Level Gateway
* Acts like a Man in the Middle (a good one)
* Inspects traffic content
* Can block malware in connections


The best way to think of this feature of firewalls is to start considering a packet filtering firewall. With that we have three modes we can operate in:

* Allow
* Deny
* Forward

I think we have thoroughly considered the first two, Allow and Deny. The forward option enables us to utilize any of the filtering options from a packet filtering firewall and forward those packets to something that can make a decision on the topic. For example, if we have a remote connection that we want the application proxy to adjudicate. We know that this connection is coming from a static IP we can simply tell the packet filtering firewall to forward that traffic to an application that can decide to allow or deny the traffic based on what is occurring within that application. That could be authentication or acceptance of some parameter like a specific message format (JSON, SQL etc etc). An example of this would be something like a captured portal or a "human test" where you pick all the traffic lights from bingo boxes of small photos. It is a way to transparently proxy traffic for a purpose. 


## Circuit-Level Gateway

* Support more services than Application-level Gateway
  * Less control over data
* Hard to handle protocols like FTP
* Clients must be aware they are using a circuit-level proxy
* Protect against fragmentation problem
* SOCKS is an Internet protocol that allows client-server applications to transparently use the services of a network firewall

## Circuit-Level Gateway

* Inspects and relays TCP/UDP/ICMP
  * Based on the state (session) for filtering
  * Authentication provides the basis for filtering
  * Does not inspect the contents of segments
  * Weaker than application-level gateway
  * Faster than application-level gateway
* Combined proxy: for lower overhead
  * Application-level proxy on inbound for protecting critical servers
  * Circuit-level on outbound (trusted users)

## SOCKS

* SOCKS is short for Sockets (SOCKetS)
* An example of a Circuit-Level Gateway
* Works at **Session Layer** of OSI model (Above Transport Layer)
* Similar to Stateful but works as a proxy
* SOCKS v5 is defined in RFC 1928

## SOCKS

* Clients, behind a firewall, need to access exterior servers
  * Connect to a SOCKS proxy server
  * Perform authentication
* Proxy server
  * Controls the eligibility of the client to access the external server using access control list
  * Passes the request on to the server if the request is allowed
* SOCKS can also be used in the opposite direction
  * Allowing the clients outside the firewall ("exterior clients") to connect to servers inside the firewall (internal servers)
  * Based on access control list

## Building a Firewall 

* In order to filter packets we need to look at packet header info
* Thinking of your levels, in the **Userspace** do we have access to this?
* In Linux this is done with `netfilter`



When we think about what we would need to do to make a firewall from scratch (well kinda from scratch, really from Linux) we will need access to the raw packet information to be able to make some sort of decision. We know that the operating system is responsible for connecting applications with hardware, in this case the Network Interface Card (NIC). The NIC will have packets come in and the OS Kernel decides what to do with them. Generally, it will strip off the headers and provide the payload to the application layer. So to get to the packets you need to plug yourself into the kernel. Years ago in order to do this we need to add our code into the kernel and then recompile it in order to run the code. This is no longer the case in Linux because we have Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM). 



## Introduce `netfilter`

![netfilter](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/netfilter.png)


To start using `netfilter` we need to utilize LKM. To show this we can startup a linux based VM and provide the following code to exibit a Loadable Kernel Module :

```c

#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

static int kmodule_init(void) {
        printk(KERN_INFO "Initializing this module\n");
        return 0;
}

static void kmodule_exit(void) {
        printk(KERN_INFO "Module cleanup\n");
}

module_init(kmodule_init);       
module_exit(kmodule_exit);      

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
```

with the following make file:

```c

obj-m += kMod.o
all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

```bash

sudo insmod kMod.ko
lsmod | grep kMod

# remove kernel modules
sudo rmmod kMod

# show the kernel message
dmesg

```



## `netfilter` Return Values

* NF_ACCEPT: Let the packet flow through the stack.
* NF_DROP: Discard the packet.
* NF_QUEUE: Pass the packet to the user space via nf_queue facility.
* NF_STOLEN: Inform the netfilter to forget about this packet, The packet is further processed by the module.
* NF_REPEAT: Request the netfilter to call this module again.

## `netfilter` Hooks

* NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT: Before the packets are in their way out of the host.
* NF_IP_POST_ROUTING: After the packets are out of the host and entering a different network.
* NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING: Before any routing decision is made
* NF_IP_LOCAL_IN: Before being sent to the network stack
* NF_IP_FORWARD: Forward packets to other hosts.

## Simple Firewall

* Block telnet -- port 23

## DMZ

* Location between the internet and internal net
* Seperate hosts that have public attack surface
* Limit services, maintain managment on internal network


A DMZ is used to provide external services on a company network. It is a way to host your webserver using existing infastructure. This eliminates the need to expose an internal network to a less secure network like the internet while providing a manner to manage the environment. 


## Things in a DMZ

* Web server
* Mail Server
* FTP Server
* API services


There are various things that go into a DMZ, many of which need additional exterior connectivity. When considering if something should go into a DMZ consider if you are considering making a firewall rule or opening a port. This should be the first thing you consider when looking at a DMZ.

## DMZ Configuration

* Single Firewall
* Dual Firewall


There are two main configuations when looking at DMZ, one has a single firewall where one interface is dedicated to a subnet, or multiple subnets which will be placed in the DMZ with specific firewall rules and routing. The second is placing the DMZ subnet between two firewalls where one firewall is the an exterior firewall with DMZ rules and the inner firewall has rules associated with the internal network.

# Class 17 Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems
## Definitions

* IDS -- Intrusion Detection System
* IPS -- Intrusion Prevention System

## References

* Wu/Irwin 19.1 - 19.7  -- IPS
* [Open Source IDS/IPS -- Suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/)

## IDS/IPS what?

* IDS performs deep packet inspection to identify threats and **reports them**.
* IPS performs deep packet inspection to identify treats and **stops them**.
* IDS is normally out of band, gets its data via a network tap or spanning port
* IPS is positioned in line with the data stream, usually part of or behind a firewall or Unified Security Gateway

## The cost of security

* IDS can have a **False Positive** where it alerts for a benign occurrence
* IDS False Positives are a nuisance to security engineers
* IPS can not have **False Positives** because it will block legitimate traffic, mucho problemo
* The speed at which the IPS must operate is the line speed of the connection
  * Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) are employed
  * Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are also employed



## HIDS vs NIDS

* IDS/IPS can live in two places 
  * HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection System)
  * NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)


IDS/IPS can live on both, or either, the network device behind a firewall or on the host as an application. The host IDS/IPS protects that one host. Because it is on the host it has great insight into what is actually going on with that particular host. It can watch applications start and processes form. This gives the HIDS the ability to take action at the host level. In recent time the technology to link HIDS together to create a coordinated effort for IDS/IPS among hosts is starting to form. These systems, like CrowdStrike or CarbonBlack, enable all the date from these hosts to come in to one location with the peace of mind knowing anomalies will be detected and stopped. 

The NIDS is the network based equivalent. An example of this is what we saw in Lab 04 with the Palo Alto Firewall. This is an appliance (either physical or virtual) that enables a network to be protected. As noted these devices tend to be more than just a firewall, and act like a security gateway, but have IDS/IPS built in. The value these products offer over each other is their attention to developing more advanced algorithms for their devices to assist in identifying and stopping attacks. From a low level this means making sure the latest malware is blocked on your system. At a high level it can coordinate information across various environments to help take down attacks on a global scale (botnets etc.)


## False Negative -- False Positive

* Which is worse for an IDS?
* Which is worse for an IPS?


Neither false negatives or false positives are desirable. A **false negative** is when something that is bad is allowed to occur. That is bad, you have failed at security. In the case of an IDS or IPS that failure mode is the same, they die in silence, no alert or attempt to block is made. James from accounting gets his credentials to wire funds stolen and the attacker drains the company bank account. On the other hand is a much more insidious beast in the **false positive** where a good thing, or benign thing, is marked as bad. This is the *boy the cried wolf* of the cyber security world. When enough false positives exist one will stop monitoring or caring about what is going on in an environment. You have the tool but fail to use it in the right way. With false positives the issue is that it is not that you have that many false positives, but that they are accurately alerting to issues that are not at the level that you care about. The correct procedure would be to fix the fact that the alert is occurring, for example "failed Windows update" by addressing the root cause of the issue. 


## Approaches to IDS/IPS

* Behavior-based -- Anomaly-based
  * Statistics-based -- based on a threshold difference from base activity, compute expensive
  * Rule Based -- Watch for specific behavior associated with attack, whenever Trick-bot hits it looks like "x"
  * High False Positive
  * Chance of Detecting Zero-Day
* Signature-based
  * Detects patterns of specific exploits seen in wild
  * Detects patterns of future exploits researches think can indicate compromise
  * Low False Positive
  * Low Chance Detecting Zero-Day

## Behavior-Based -- Anomaly-Based

* The behavior of a system is a baseline for a properly operating system
* From that baseline you can measure anomalies and then set a threshold as to what quantifies an anomaly that is acted on
* False positives are a way of life in this exercise as network conditions change and changes occur


In the world of behavior based detection it is important to establish a baseline of what is good to measure off of. The issue with this is that most security engineers and system administrators do not know the requisite information about how the items on the their network are supposed to work to provide that insight to establish such a known-good baseline. To that end, understanding what is good is an ever changing ever evolving exercise. That is part of the reason this course is not only exposing you to lost of tools and "solutions" but also the ability to make independent assessments of those things using tools like wireshark to see what is happening at the packet level. We can imagine that it is possible to establish a baseline that quantifies the different baselines that a system operates on. Each system has a baseline for how it should be interacting with another and user workflows are established to the point where regular usage would enable fine parameters on the developed profile. At that point in a behavior based system you can then measure deltas off that baseline and decide at what value you would like to be alerted. This threshold can give an engineer the ability to detect anomalies that could lead to discovering an otherwise unknown attack, a Zero-day exploit. A Zero-Day is an exploit that has had zero days to be patched. If the patch is avaliable and not applied that is not an example of a new exploit in the wild, but the willful negligence of system administrators and security engineers. For example if your baseline SSH traffic is limited to 100kbps and you see a spike at 300kpbs you may want to look into that. At that point you notice multiple sessions being established and dropped with one remaining after a number have failed. You may be witnessing an otherwise unknown attack on your SSH access. If the baseline of 100kbps had not been established you may not have noticed such a small change in traffic. The bottom line is, you can never measure what you are not looking at, and you can't look at things correctly if you don't understand them. Demand that those who own systems understand all the aspects about them and settle for nothing less. 


## Adaptive/Self-Learning Profile

* With Adaptive profiles they can account for a degree of abnormality and false alarms
* Self-learning is used to help Anomaly based detection

## Denial of Service detection

* Threshold-based detection -- Set a pre-programmed limit on data traffic to ensure server availability
* Self-learning method -- Uses patterns of traffic to develop acceptable model
* Combining both detection methods provides a high degree of accuracy on DoS and DDoS attacks

## Behavior-based detection

* Protocol Anomaly -- Something wrong in the protocol, tunneling P2P on Port 80
* Statistical Anomaly -- A model of how network usually works, 3-way handshakes vs 4-way close

# Signature vs Behavior

| Signature Based                  | Behavioral Based                                                    |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clearly identifies attack method | provides clues like behavioral or statically rule that was violated.  |

* Behavioral rarely shows what the attack is but will show what happened

## Machine Learning IDS/IPS

* Utilize ML Training (Supervised, Semi-Supervised, Unsupervised)
* Incorporate various machine learning methods

# Class 18 Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems Deux
## Definitions

* TTP -- Tactics, Techniques and Procedures

## HIPS

* Host based protection: AKA Next Gen Anti-virus
  * Anti-virus/anti-malware
  * Firewall
  * IDS/IPS
* Usually centrally managed
* Vulnerable to tampering if host is compromised (before or after installation)
* Small view of situation
* Lost of anomalies leads to False Positives

Many products have spent time focusing on protecting the host. As the end point the host has, over time, been ignored because it was easier to implement network controls and try to give hosts a "safe place" to be in. With more mobile workforce, hosts can be assumed to almost always be in hostile networks. This exposes these hosts to all layers of attack. From physical attack to application, you get the full stack threat surface to a mobile worker. As business brings workers to other nations we only compound those issues. Host Based Intrusion Prevention has been replaced by "Next Gen Anti-Virus" as a way to sell a method of protecting the host that is both behavioral and signature based. It is difficult to determine anomalies because the end user tends to have a varied and diverse use case. For example, you may allow video-chatting with family on the same machine as processing office documents, or accessing a private database. With all these things we need to consider the network stack as we consider the best way to build and protect systems. 

* What would you do to protect the end user machine?
* What impact would your controls have on productivity?

## How HIPS does it

* Builds a list of objects to track and databases them
* Tracks system calls, file and log modifications, binaries, shell commands, back-doors/rootkits etc
* Can utilize the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to protect the system
* Inspect traffic after SSL or VPN decryption


This is a good time to talk about what we are actually looking for on the host. In addition to changes to binaries and manipulation of logs and time we are looking for viruses/malware/rootkits anything that is going to do bad things on the system that was not there before. We do not know all the things out there so we have two approaches, behavioral and signature. We have briefly discussed the idea of what a virus is (we will use that turn for all the bad things mentioned above). It is easy to identify a virus body and block against it. This can be done with a simple hash signature or digest. From there, we just check the hash and if it is the same we block it, and if not we can allow it to be on a system and run... EASY DAY...right? Attacked decided they didn't have enough Windows XP machines to break into easy enough, so they then decided to start encrypting the body of the virus with a decryptor, which made it slightly harder to track and stop but really not much of an improvement. From there, attackers decided to employ **oliomortphic** viruses that would have multiple decryptors which were more difficult to get a signature on but because they always had a pattern it was easy enough for AV to create a **Dynamic Decryptor** that would enable the payload to be decrypted and identified. That brings us to **polymorphic** viruses that had millions of decryptors and were no longer able to track because they were able to recompile and change the decryptor on the fly, impossible to track in the traditional means. At that point we need, as a AV defender, to look at the decrypted virus and try to allow the virus to produce the decrypted virus body to see what it is. Note: now we have a live virus to deal with... We can do this by sand-boxing and running in a quarantine area, but the science is not yet perfect. To add to the issue, **metamorphic** viruses that not only change their decryptors on the fly, but employ a similar style decryptor but also the body chances with ever decryption. This is the minority in the virus world but as you can imagine it is very difficult tot detect.

## NIPS Jobs

* Packet dropping
* Session termination
* Adjustment of Firewall Rules
* Traffic shaping
* Alert Generation
* Log Generation


Network Intrusion Prevention has a number of jobs it accomplishes. It is responsible for terminating sessions, adjusting firewalls rules, traffic shaping, alert generating and log generating. Interesting the text points out dropping of packets. This is notable only because the basic packet filtering we discussed the ability to ALLOW, REJECT or DROP (we also discussed forward in the proxy sense). So what is the difference between REJECT and DROP. To understand this lets look to the documentation responsible for such designations, RFC1122 section 3.2.2.1 and 4.2.3.9:

```bash
3.2.2.1  Destination Unreachable: RFC-792
A Destination Unreachable message that is received MUST be reported to the transport layer. The transport layer SHOULD use the information appropriately; for example, see Sections 4.1.3.3, 4.2.3.9, and 4.2.4 below. A transport protocol that has its own mechanism for notifying the sender that a port is unreachable (e.g., TCP, which sends RST segments) MUST nevertheless accept an ICMP Port Unreachable for the same purpose.

4.2.3.9  ICMP Messages
  TCP MUST act on an ICMP error message passed up from the IP layer, directing it to the connection that created the error.  The necessary demultiplexing information can be found in the IP header contained within the ICMP message.
Destination Unreachable -- codes 2-4
These are hard error conditions, so TCP SHOULD abort the connection
```

As we can see the biggest difference is in a REJECT and ICMP error is send back and for a drop it does not send a response. In a legitimate case a user with REJECT will allow the attempt to cease immediately. Where a drop will retry for at least 100 seconds. So not great for users. For attackers, the idea was using DROP will not give information filtered ports vs closed ports. In modern scanner they will not retry for 100 seconds and don't care if the port is rejected or dropped. You can decide the cost to the user vs the attacker and which will most likely spend more time fighting with it but there is little reason to opt for DROP over REJECT. If you do, try not to veil it in an air of security.


## NIDS/NIPS

* Sensors track traffic on switches and routers either in line (IPS) or with a tap or span port.
* Watch for unusual traffic patterns.
* Protect all aspects of network traffic to all devices, like access points or printers.
* Protect against DDoS.
* Monitor user traffic for malicious command sequence.
* Monitor user traffic for anomalies (using admin protocols etc).


There are many benefits to NIDS/NIPS at a network level. They provide the ability to have a high level view on your environment. They can look at traffic and identify when something is not going as expected. Internally it can track and control the spread of malicious commands and from the outside protect against attacks against availability. 


## NIDS/NIPS Drawbacks

* Can't protect against attacks if payload is encrypted (SSL, SSH)
* Has no insight into host
* High compute requirements to maintain line speeds

## Put them together

* By combining HIDS and NIDS (HIPS and SIPS) you get a more complete picture
* Threats can be correlated between the two
* NIDS has a global view
* HIDS has a ground truth view
* Many times called **Distributed Intrusion Detection**
* Sound like something we already talked about?

## IP Reputation

* As attackers user IP addresses to attack the IPs can be blacklisted via IP reputation
* Do you think you would use your IP to attack? Why not?

## Honeypot

* A mechanism to lure attackers into a false vulnerable system
* Primarily to slow attackers and gain insight into TTPs

# Class 20 SSL/TLS

## Definitions

* SSL -- Secure Sockets Layer
* TLS -- Transport Layer Security
* IETF -- Internet Engineering Task Force
* AEAD -- Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
* RSA -- Rivest, Shamir and Adelman
* MAC -- Message Authentication Code

## What is SSL/TLS

* A mechanism to encrypt data in transit -- Confidentiality
* Method to ensure no tampering -- Integrity
* A way to verify you are talking to who you are talking to -- Authentication (can be done with certificates)
* Runs on top of TCP 
* Can be used for almost anything, however we mainly see it used for web-applications. HTTP over TLS would be HTTPS
* Other uses include VOIP, Chat and Email

We have started having the bad habit of allowing ourselves to use the terms SSL, Secure Sockets Layer, and TLS, Transport Layer Security, interchangeably. We will endeavor to explain why that is a bad idea and attempt to remedy that habit by being specific in reference to TLS and SSL. The original idea was that the internet needed a standard way to transport information across a network encrypted. 

## SSL/TLS a short History

* Not really needed until they noticed information starting to be tampered for the first time
* SSL 1.0
  * Internal Netscape design, early 1994
  * Scrapped during technical presentation
* SSL 2.0
  * Published by Netscape, November 1994
  * Several weaknesses
* SSL 3.0 (RFC 6101)
  * Designed by Netscape and Paul Kocher, November 1996
  * If the internet were to be adopted by SSL, they didn't want it to be tied with Netscape
* TLS 1.0 (RFC 2246)
  * Internet standard based on SSL 3.0, January 1999
  * Not inter-operable with SSL 3.0
  * TLS uses HMAC instead of MAC
  * Uses any port


  You may not remember but one of the first browsers was the Netscape Navigator. In the early days of the Internet there was no good way to protect data going across the wire as web pages started to become more dynamic. The Netscape Corporation (now part of Verizon Media) needed a way to protect the confidentiality of information traveling between their customers and servers. For that they developed SSL 1.0 which was developed in early 1994 but was never released because of well known vulnerabilities in it that it is said was discovered within the first 10 minutes of presenting it in a technical demo to MIT students. SSL 2.0 was also released by Netscape as a proprietary product from Netscape, it was released in November 1994 and was withdrawn a year later. During the same time frame Microsoft released PCT (Private Communications Technology) using Secure Transport Layer Protocol (STLP), another proprietary product, it was perfect and it is what we are using today... It was actually not perfect and it did not see the success that SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 did. In November 1995 Netscape addressed some of the serious issues with SSL 2.0 and released SSL 3.0. SSL 3.0 is considered insecure now but still is supported by 6% websites according to [Qualys](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/). In 1999 what was going to be SSL 3.1 was renamed TLS 1.0 to break the relation (you guessed it by request of Microsoft) with Netscape and was developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and gained wide adoption. Despite being based on SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 is not actually inter-operate with SSL 3.0. For the first time we have a standard for 


## The History Continues (Post Text Book)

* TLS 1.1 (RFC 4346)
  * Not Secure
  * 2006 Update to address flaws related to [BEAST](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2013/09/10/is-beast-still-a-threat) cyber attack in 2011
* TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246)
  * 2008 Update to address flaws not seen in wild
  * Was the standard unti the Snowden Leaks
* 2013 Snowden Leaks -- Expose vulnerabilities in TLS 1.2
* TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446)
  * 2013 work begins on TLS 1.3
  * Represents about 25% of all sites supporting 1.3: crazy since it was released in 2013
* 2015 [POODLE Attack](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A) targets flaws in SSL 3.0
* 2016 [DROWN Attack](https://drownattack.com/drown-attack-paper.pdf) targets flaws in SSL 2.0


The sordid history of SSL/TLS continues in 2006 with TLS 1.1 which addresses a flaw that would later be exploited in the BEAST attack in 2011 (5 years later). Why did this attack happen 5 years after it was superseded? TLS 1.2 adds Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) which removes the necessity for block ciphers and vulnerability in Cipher Block Chaining CBC. After 2008 life starts getting interesting for TLS as we are deep in the heyday of the internet. A focus is made on SSL/TLS issue with the starting of [SSL Labs](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-10/presentations/Ristic/BlackHat-USA-2010-Ristic-Qualys-SSL-Survey-HTTP-Rating-Guide-slides.pdf) at BlackHat in 2010 still avaliable at [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). At this point HTTPS is still not quite mainstream, so someone made a product called [Firesheep](https://codebutler.github.io/firesheep/) that enabled someone to recreate an entire session trivial. We are ready to enter 2011 the year of SSL. In March RFC 6176 formally deprecated HTTPS however it is still in use on over 54% of web-servers. With that we see the Comodo breach what saw seven high-profile domain names get breached, the BEAST attack and the DigiNotar compromise that forced the revocation of a root Certificate Authority. We see continued issues with insufficient on Entropy, FLAME Malware, CRIME vulnerability, Lucky 13 attack, discovery of the RC4 biases, TIME info leakage, Edward Snowden leaks, BREACH Attacks. We finally decide to develop TLS 1.3 while at the same time Chrome 29 decides to support TLS 1.2. It doesn't end there in that we see the Triple Handshake Attack and the critical flow in OpenSSL known as Heartbleed.

  * Handshake Protocol -- utilize public-key cryptography to share a secret between a client and server, slow progress that takes a lot of overhead
  * Record Protocol -- use the established secret to encrypt communications between two hosts (how bulk communication is established), more efficient 

  At the most basic level SSL/TLS works by using Public Key Cryptography to share a secret between two machines that only need to share trust to transfer the public key and verify identity (most of the time only verifying the identity of the server side). The idea is that with Public Key Infrastructure there are a number of trusted Root Certificate Authorities (Root CA's) that are trusted by web browsers by default. These Root CA's are responsible for issuing a key pair (certificates) to verified sites that they can use to identify themselves as well as well as allow the client to open up a asymmetrical encryption channel to transfer a symmetrical key used for the bulk of the data transfer. The **Handshake Protocol** is the asymmetrical encryption that allow the transfer of the symmetrical key for the **Record Protocol**. The data transfer requires a symmetrical key using **Record Protocol** because the speed of the symmetrical key encryption and decryption is too computationally expensive and using a session key is much more efficient.

  Generally for TLS 1.3 we are looking at and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for the Asymmetrical **Handshake** over the RSA (1977 by Rivest, Shamir and Adelman) which is vulnerable to being not **forward-secret**. Forward secret meaning that in the event that an entire conversation is recorded using RSA it is encrypted. However, if the private key is somehow obtained at a later date the session key can be recovered and thus the message can be decrypted. 

## SSL/TLS Handshake

* A focus will be on TLS however the text references SSL quite a bit
* Goals of Handshake
  * Agree on Cipher Suite
  * Agree on a Secret (for bulk encryption)
  * Establish trust between Client & Server (you are who you say you are)

## TLS Handshake

* Client "Hello"
* Server "Hello"
* Server Sends Certificate
* Server "Hello Done"
* Client Key Exchange
* Client Change Cipher Spec
* Client Finished
* Server Change Cipher Spec
* Server Finished


The purpose of the TLS handshake is to establish the conditions in which a secure exchange can be executed. For our purposes this exchange is initiated by the client, in the assumption we are looking at a traditional client accessing a server (note, this same process is valid for SSL VPNs or server to server communications). The handshake start with a "Client Hello" that outlines the capabilities of the client to the server, namely the cipher suit an in TLS 1.3 some preshared keys. The server will then reply with the type of encryption being used and the servers certificate which enables the client to encrypt a session key in the encryption method that was selected. The server will then send a "Hello Done" message. At this point the client can verify the certificate and assure that the server is valid and will generate a pre-master secret, encrypts the secret with the certificate. The client will send a "Key Exchange Message", encrypted with the certificate, that includes the generated **pre-master secret** which can be used by both the client and server to calculate the bulk encryption secret for the session or **Session Key**. The client will send a "Client Change Cipher Spec" message then a "Client Finished" message using the Session Key to test the Session Key. The server will then reply with a "Change Cipher Spec" followed by a "Server Finished" message using the Session Key. At this point both machines have established a secure method to communicated based on the successful delivery of the finished messages using the Session Key, the session is established and the Session Key can be used for bulk encryption. 


## TLS Handshake Part Deux

## Cipher Suite

* Protocol -- TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.0, SSL V3, SSL V2
* Key Exchange -- DH, DHE, ECDH, ECDHE, RSA
* Authentication -- RSA, ECDSA
* Cipher -- AES, AES-GCM, AES-CBC, Camellia, DES, RC4, RC2
* Message Authentication Code -- HMAC-MD5,HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256/384, AEAD


As one can see the idea of a Cipher Suite Includes the Protocol Version (TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 etc.), the Key Exchange Algorithm, Authentication Method, Block Cipher, and Message Authentication Code for data integrity. As you can imagine with older versions of items in these categories getting flaws uncovered and new replacements being produced this list grew to an invariable large number. This, and because browsers just want things to work, have provided the incentive to add lots of different combinations to all aspects of the SSL/TLS cipher suites (up until TLS 1.3). Right now there are only a few combinations that are secure in TLS 1.2. 


## TLS <= 1.2

![TLS 1.2 -- All the options](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/tls1_2.PNG)

* 37 Cipher Suites Supported
* Adding Previous versions of TLS/SSLv3 319 Cipher Suites

## Why all the options

![TLS 1.2 -- So many options](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/tls12.PNG)

## Key to security is simplicity

![TLS 1.3 -- Only a few options](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/tls13.PNG)

## TLS 1.3 Cipher Suite

![A simple Cipher Suite](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/cipher_suite.PNG)

## TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites

* TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
* TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256
* TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256


Take a look at CloudFlares analysis of [TLS 1.3](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/) With it we learn more about the details on why the move is necessary. You will notice that each there is no key exchange noted because it is assumed to be some variant of Diffie-Hellman. With a few cipher suites to support it is easy to streamline negotiation and put effort into securing those technologies employed.

# Class 21 -- Network Access Control

## Definitions

* NAC -- Network Access Control (Network Admission Control via CISCO)
* NAP -- Network Access Protection (Microsoft)
* TPM -- Trusted Platform Module
* EAP -- Extensible Authentication Protocol
* RADIUS -- Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service

## NAC Overview

* A method to protect access to the network
* Includes:
  * NAC Central Manager
  * NAC Policy Server
  * Host Agent
  * Protected Infrastructure

## NAC

![NAC Overview](https://cga.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/cns/images/NAC.PNG)

## What you need

* Database of Users, and Hosts
* ACLs (Access Control Lists): rules
* MS Active Directory (directory service that allows you to keep track of assests and users) and security Policies
* Firewall/IDS/IPS: network security system
* Host agent/anti-virus/anti-malware
* RADIUS/802.1X: authentication mechanism 
* VLAN/Switch/Router
* VPN: virtual private network 


If you have not figured this out yet network access control includes just about everything working together to make keeping the network secure possible. From policies to switches all the components of the network, host and servers need to work in concert to accomplish the goals of enforcing the security policies on the network. Imagine that in order to get onto the network you need to have current critical patches applied and you need to login using a second factor? That could cover the "health" of your device and verification of identity. From there the correct policies are applied to you access so that you are only getting access to the parts of the network you are allowed. The devil in the details is that this process is little more than a gateway to everything without adequate policies and data categorization being in place to assist in allowing only specific access to what that individual needs for their work role.


## NAC Policies

* ACL -- control resource access based on user role (providing you role based access)
* NAC Server constantly monitors "health" of user (what level of trust do we have/get, higher trust = more access)
* Policy can quarantine systems without adequate "health"


When looking at enforcing policies or "rules" for access to the network and the data therein we need to go back to the tools we have used in the past. The ACL is the basis for the user role which provides rules based on identity parameters and can perform both authentication and authorization. This is found and controlled at the **NAC Server**. It can provide direction on how host negotiates access to the system. Does the host get into a guest area or head to a post-admission control and monitoring. This monitoring can include checking and tracking items like:
* Windows Registry Settings
* Presents of security related agents
* Anti-Virus/Anti-malware, IDS/IPS status and findings
* Running processes

Host monitoring can continue while connected to assure that the "health" does not change during the period as well as providing data for logging and auditing purposes. This is a good time to reference some of the STIG setting we looked at for monitoring  


## NAC Agent

* The host agent with insight into all aspects of host
* Ability to report and take actions on the host

## Enforcement Points

* The NAC server can control access at enforcement points
* Enforcement points include:
  * Switch Router -- VLAN
  * VPN Concentrator -- ACL/Firewall
  * Wireless access -- 802.1X
  * DHCP Server -- IP of subnet
  * LAN Authentication -- 802.1X

## 802.1X

* Authentication Mechanism for LAN and WiFi
* Can be provided for port security for LAN ports
* EAP/RADIUS used to authenticate devices (MAC, Cert, etc)
* Works with NAC Server to allow access based on privilege
