###### Estimating

###### Business Value

o Identify sources: increased sales;
decreased costs; reduced
headcount; lower turnover...
o Assign values as initial estimates
Click to add text


## Feasibility Analysis

######  Detailed business case for the project

```
o Technical feasibility
o Economic feasibility
o Organizational feasibility
```
######  Compiled into a feasibility study

######  Critically important to reassess feasibility

###### throughout the project


## Technical Feasibility: Can We Build It?

```
 Sources of Technical Risk:
o Users’ and analysts’ lack of familiarity with the business application
area
o Lack of familiarity with technology
▪ Have we used it before? How new is it?
o Project size
▪ Number of people, time frame, distinct features
o Compatibility with existing systems
▪ Degree of integration required
```

## Economic Feasibility: Should We Build

## It?

#####  Identify costs and benefits

#####  Assign values to costs and benefits

#####  Determine cash flow

#####  Assess financial viability

```
o Return on investment
o Break even point
o Net present value
```

###### Costs and

###### Benefits

o Include development and
operational costs
o Consider tangible and intangible
benefits


## Economic Feasibility Measures

###  Return on Investment (ROI)

 ROI = (Total Benefits – Total Costs) / Total Costs

###  Break Even Point (BEP) or Payback Period

####  PEB = # Neg Yrs + (Net Cash flow-

#### Cumulative Cash Flow)/(Net Cash Flow)


## Economic Feasibility Measures

###  Present Value (PV)

```
 PV = (Cash Flow)/( 1 + Rate of Return)
n
```
###  Net Present Value (NPV)

####  NPV = ∑ PV Total Benefits - ∑ PV Total

#### Costs


## Practice - ROI

It’s estimated that a new project will cost $150,000 in development
costs, and $50,000 in operational costs each year for three years. It’s
estimated that it will create $110,000 in benefits each year in the
same three years. What is the ROI?
ROI = (Total Benefits – Total Costs) / (Total Costs)
Total Costs = $150,000 + ( 3 X $50,000) = $300,
Total Benefits = 3 X $110,000 = $330,
ROI = ($330,000 - $300,000)/ $300,
ROI = 10 %


## Practice - BEP

```
BEP= Yrsof NegCash Flow
+ (That year net cash flow –That year
cumulative cash flow)/(That year net cash
flow)
= 3 + ((534,149-338,670)/534,149)
= 3 + (195,479/534,149)
= 3 +. 37
=3.37 years
```

## Practice - PV

```
 PV = (Cash Flow)/( 1 + Rate of Return)
n
 $ 100 paid to you in three years
 Rate of return available 10 %
 PV = 100 /( 1 +. 1 )
3
 PV = 100 / 1.
3
 PV = 100 /1.331 = 75.
```

###### Cost-Benefit

###### Analysis

o Discounted cash flow method
preferred
o NPV preferred


## Organizational Feasibility:

## If We Build It, Will They Come?

```
 Strategic alignment
o Are project goals aligned with business strategy?
 Evaluate effect on various stakeholders
o Strong and influential project champion?
o Strong and widespread organizational management support?
o Receptive / resistant system users?
```

## Organizational Feasibility

## If We Build It, Will They Come?

```
 Strategic alignment
o Close alignment with strategy increases the likelihood of success
 Stakeholder groups can be influenced
o Presentations describing and promoting benefits
o Emphasizing personal benefits as well as organizational benefits
o Prototypes help prove the system concept
o Real user involvement throughout project
```

## Feasibility Assessment: Summing It Up

```
 All projects have feasibility risks
o Our goal is to know the risks we face and the significance of those risks
o Project Sponsor, Project Manager, and other team members need this
awareness
o Once risks are known, steps can be taken to mitigate the risks
▪ For example, if unfamiliar with a new technology
```
- Provide enough budget for training
- Provide enough budget to hire consultants with expertise
- Allow more schedule time to move up the learning curve
- Use a methodology that incorporates experimentation


## Feasibility Assessment: Summing It Up

######  Essential to continuously review and revise the

###### feasibility assessment

```
o How well are we managing the risks we previously identified?
Are adjustments needed?
▪ Risk is being managed
▪ Risk is not well managed and needs further attention
o Are there any new risks that have appeared?
▪ If so, what are the actions needed to address those risks?
▪ Budgetary and schedule effect?

## Project Manager’s Balancing Act

#### Project Management

#### involves making trade-

#### offs...

#### Modifying one element

#### requires adjusting the others

```
Project Size
```

## Project Estimation

```
 The process of assigning projected values for time and effort
 Sources of estimates
oMethodology in use
oActual previous projects
oExperienced developers
 Estimates begin as a range and become more specific as the
project progresses
oIndustry standards
oFunction point estimation (Appendix 2A)
```

## Project Estimates Using Industry

## Standard Percentages

INDUSTRY STANDARD PERCENTAGES EXAMPLE
IF 4 months are required for Planning, then
15% X = 4, where X = overall length of project
X = 4 / 15%
X = 26.66 months for entire project
Therefore:◦ Planning (15%): 4 months
◦◦ Analysis (20%): Design (35%): 5.33 9.33 monthsmonths
◦ Implementation (30%): 8 months
◦ Total Project Length: 26.66 months


## Identifying Tasks

 Use established guidelines – existing methodologies
 Use analogies – model previous projects’ task lists
 Top-down approach – break high level tasks into smaller, detailed
tasks
 Organize into work breakdown structure


## Example – Determining Tasks using

## Top-down Approach

 Grade programming assignments
1.Create grading plan
A.Develop grading rubric
B.Develop test plan, test data, and check figures
2.Prepare programming projects for grading
A.Download submitted projects
B.For all projects, extract zipped files
3.For all projects,
A.Administer test plan and check performance and results
B.Check code for required elements
C.Apply rubric and determine final score.


### Typical

### Workplan Entry


## Project Work Plan


## Project Work Plan


## Staffing Considerations

 Match skills to project needs whenever possible
 Consider technical skills and interpersonal skills
oAll IS work is done in teams
oTechnical skills are not sufficient – need to be able to
work with others
oUse training and outside sources (consultants, vendor
support) when skills are not readily available
 Staffing levels will change over a project’s lifetime
 Adding staff adds overhead; not always productive


## Motivation

 Use monetary rewards cautiously
 Use intrinsic rewards
oRecognition
oAchievement
oThe work itself
oResponsibility
oAdvancement
oChance to learn new skills


## Motivation

 Consider the “de-motivators” ... DO NOT
oAssign unrealistic deadlines
oIgnore good efforts
oAccept a low-quality product
oGive everyone on the project the same raise
oMake an important decision without the team’s input
oMaintain poor working conditions


## Assuring Group Performance

 Make sure team understands the project and its goals
 Establish operating procedures (Project Charter)
oAvailability
oStatus reporting
oMeetings
 Ensure that team members get to know each other
 Establish methods for dealing with problems


## Project Estimates Require Refinement

```
oEven projects with high-quality
estimates will need refinement
oProject managers must adjust
estimated time throughout the
project
```

## Managing Scope

 Beware of scope creep
 Use JAD and prototyping to minimize scope creep pressure
 Implement formal change approval process
 Defer additional requirements as future system enhancements


## Timeboxing

 Time estimating techniques may reveal that the project requires
more time than we have available
 Timeboxing helps in these situations
oSet a tight but realistic deadline. Identify core, essential functional
requirements
oTeam limits its focus just to essential functions
oHigh quality is stressed
oOther functions will be added later
oRepeat to add refinements and enhancements


## When a Target Date is Missed...

 Don’t assume you can catch up
 The ONLY situation in which you can make up time is when:
oThe remainder of the project is simpler than the part you fell behind on, and
oThe remainder of the project is simpler than you expected when the original
estimates were made.
 Evaluate the complexity of the remainder of the project to
determine the correct schedule adjustment.
 Adding people is not always the right way to handle schedule
slippages.

SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN, 6TH EDITION

DENNIS, WIXOM, AND ROTH

Roberta M. Roth © 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 1


## Learning Objectives

```
 Employ the requirement elicitation techniques of interviews, JAD sessions,
questionnaires, document analysis, and observation.
 Define the role that each requirement elicitation technique plays in
determining requirements.
```

# Requirements

# Elicitation Techniques

WAYS TO DISCOVER REQUIREMENTS


## Requirements Elicitation in Practice

####  Use every interaction with managers and users to garner

#### interest, support, and enthusiasm for project

####  Choose participants carefully

####  Make respectful use of people’s time


## Interviews

####  Most important and most used fact-finding technique

```
o The systems analysts collects information from individuals face to
face
```
####  Who should be interviewed?

```
o Managers in early project stages to get broad understanding
o Staff can provide details and specifics later.
o Political issues are important – may be necessary to interview
influential people, even if they are not too knowledgeable
```

## Interviews, con’t.

####  Interview Structure

```
o Top-Down (broad to specific; most common)
o Bottom-up (specific to broad; useful for collecting details)
```
####  Question Type

```
o Open-ended – broad concepts; opinions
o Closed-ended – learn or confirm facts and details
o Probing – resolve confusion; follow-up
```

## Interview as a Requirements Elicitation

## Technique

STRENGTHS

```
◦ Interviewee can respond freely and
openly to questions.
◦ Interviewee can be asked for more
feedback.
◦ Questions can be adapted or
reworded for each individual.
◦ Interviewee’s nonverbal
communication can be observed.
```
```
WEAKNESSES
```
```
◦ Very time-consuming, and therefore
costly, fact-finding approach.
◦ Success is highly dependent on the
systems analyst's human relations
skills.
◦ May be impractical due to the
location of interviewees.
```

## Interviewing – Practical Tips

####  Prepare, prepare, prepare!

####  Don’t waste the interviewee’s time

####  Take notes during and after the interview

####  Don’t be afraid to ask for clarification

####  Be aware of non-verbal cues (body language)

####  Send interview summary as soon as possible. Request

#### confirmation and corrections


## JAD – Joint Application Development

#####  An extensive, structured group process

#####  GOAL: produce complete requirements definition document

#####  Directly involves project sponsor, key managers, and key

##### users with systems analysts

#####  Requires a trained facilitator

#####  Requires a comfortable facility for long-term, intensive group

##### work; preferably off-site

#####  Expensive but valuable


## Electronic JAD – e-JAD

####  Any group activity may experience problems with group

#### dynamics

####  e- JAD helps group overcome group dynamic issues –

#### dominance, status differences, fear of reprisal

####  e-JAD provides ways for members to contribute,

#### comment on, and rate ideas anonymously

####  Requires a trained e-JAD facilitator and groupware

#### software


## JAD Practical Tips

####  Obtain training as a facilitator

####  Top management support needed to enable the right

#### people to commit to the JAD sessions

####  Following completion of JAD sessions, distribute

#### Requirements Definition document to group for

#### confirmation and correction

####  Introduce JAD to organization with small demo project

#### and build on that experience


## Questionnaires

####  Special-purpose documents that allow the analyst to

#### collect information and opinions from respondents.

```
o Mass produced and distributed.
o Respondents complete the questionnaire on their own time.
```
####  Facts are collected from a large number of people while

#### maintaining uniform responses.

```
o When dealing with a large audience, no other fact-finding technique
can tabulate the same facts as efficiently.
```

## Questionnaires, con’t.

####  Fixed-format questions

```
o Similar to a multiple choice exam question
o Must be able to anticipate potential answers to questions
o Easy to tabulate results
```
####  Free-format questions

```
o Like an essay question – open-ended
o Response is unpredictable
o Harder to tabulate results
```

## Questionnaires as a Requirements

## Elicitation Technique

STRENGTHS

```
◦ Most can be answered quickly (if
properly designed).
◦ Relatively inexpensive.
◦ Allow individuals to maintain
anonymity.
◦ Can be tabulated and analyzed
quickly (if properly designed).
```
```
WEAKNESSES
◦ Response is often low. How to motivate
participation?
◦ Incomplete questionnaires returned –
are these worthless?
◦ Tend to be inflexible.
◦ Body language cannot be observed.
◦ Cannot clarify a vague or incomplete
answer to any question.
◦ Difficult to prepare a successful
questionnaire.
```

## Questionnaires – Practical Tips

#####  To Develop a (Good) Questionnaire

```
o Determine what facts and opinions must be collected and from whom you
should get them
o Based on the needed facts and opinions, determine whether free- or fixed-
format questions will produce the best answers. A mix of types may be
ideal.
o Write the questions
o Pretest the questions on a small sample of “typical” respondents – not just
other systems analysts
o Use random sampling if necessary
```

## Observation

####  Participate in or watch a person perform activities to learn

#### about the system

####  Use when the validity of data collected using other

#### methods is in question.

####  Use when the complexity of certain aspects of the system

#### prevents end-users from providing a clear explanation


## Observation as a Requirements

## Elicitation Technique

STRENGTHS

```
◦ Data gathered may be highly
reliable.
◦ Can see exactly what is being done.
◦ Relatively inexpensive (compared
with other fact-finding techniques).
◦ Can do work measurements (if
needed).
```
```
WEAKNESSES
```
```
◦ People may perform differently
when being observed.
◦ Work may vary in difficulty and
volume.
◦ Some activities may take place at
odd times.
◦ The tasks being observed are subject
to various types of interruptions.
```

## Observation– Practical Tips

####  To Do Observation Well...

```
o Properly plan for observation.
o Obtain approval and inform people of your purpose.
o Conduct observations first when the work load is normal, followed
by observations during peak periods.
o Obtain samples of documents or forms that will be used by those
being observed.
o Apply the sampling techniques discussed earlier for observation.
o Review observation notes with appropriate individuals.
```

## Document Analysis

####  Collect Facts from Existing Documentation

```
o Organizational chart.
o History that led to the project.
o Documentation of previous system studies and designs performed by
systems analysts and consultants.
```
####  Analyze Facts to Determine Currency

```
o Even outdated documentation may be useful, but recognize what is
current and what is outdated.
```

## Document Analysis, con’t.

####  Analyze to Understand the Documentation

```
o Take notes, draw pictures, and use systems analysis and design tools
to model what you are learning or proposing for the system.
```
####  Use Appropriate Sampling Techniques


## Document Analysis – Practical Tips

####  To Employ Document Analysis Well...

```
o Good place to start
```
- History
- Vocabulary
- Key personnel
o Learn as much as you can from existing documentation. No one
wants to spend time talking about things you could have learned
about from existing documentation.


## Practical Tips – Summing It Up

####  Do your homework

```
o Use indirect sources to get oriented to the environment (research,
document analysis)
```
####  Respect the participants’ time

####  Select participants carefully – political influence can be

#### important

####  Use requirements-gathering process to “promote” the

#### project


## Practical Tips – Summing It Up, con’t.

#####  Document analysis

```
o Problem history, terminology/vocabulary; key players
```
#####  Observation

```
o Rich data source but remember to interpret carefully. Focus on “real”
system, not by-the-book
```
#####  Surveys/questionnaires

```
o Broad coverage, lower costs
o Pretest with “typical” respondents
o Be creative to encourage participation
```

## Practical Tips – Summing It Up, con’t.

####  Joint Application Development (JAD/e-JAD)

```
o Trained facilitator is essential to success
o Select participants carefully
o Proven to reduce scope creep because participants understand the
process of identifying requirements
```

## Practical Tips – Summing It Up, con’t.

####  Interviews

```
o NOT a simple conversational dialogue
o Planning and preparation pay off
o Get a range of perspectives – managerial to operational
o Use an approach that suits the interviewee
o Allow time to digest what you have learned
o Remember to follow-up to confirm/clarify
o Be ready to handle unexpected behaviors

```

# What is a Use Case?

U N D E R S TA N D I N G T H E P U R P O S E O F T H IS TO O L



## Role of Use Cases

```
 Use cases express and clarify user requirements.
 Purpose - define the expected interaction between user and
system.
 Use that interaction to more fully describe functional requirements
 Used extensively in the analysis phase. Often a part of user
interviews or JAD sessions.
 Text-based use cases are easy for the users to understand.
 Flow easily into the creation of process models and the data
model.
```

## Use Cases

```
 Represents how a system interacts with its environment
 Illustrates the activities that are performed by the users and
the system’s responses.
 Activities produce some output result.
 Each use case describes how an external user triggers an
event to which the system must respond.
 In event-driven modeling, everything in the system can be
thought of as a response to some triggering event.
```

# Use Case Styles

E LE M E N T S A N D FO R M AT S


## Elements of a Use Case

```
 Each use case has a name and number, and brief description.
 The priority may be assigned to indicate the relative
significance.
 The actor refers to a person, another system, or a hardware
device that interacts with the system to achieve a useful goal.
 The trigger for the use case – the event that causes the use
case to begin.
 Events triggers can be external or temporal

See Figure 4-3 for example



## Fully-Dressed Use Case Format, con’t.

### Use this format when:

##### o Users are not closely engaged with development team

##### o Project has high complexity and high risk

##### o Test cases need to be fully described

##### o Remote collaborating teams need detailed, shared

##### understanding of user needs.


## Use Case Practical Tips

####  Use gradual refinement.

####  Concentrate on describing the user’s objectives with the

#### system completely and accurately.

####  Keep both audiences in mind – users and developers.

####  Create use cases only when needed to clarify what the

#### system must do from the user’s perspective. Not

#### needed for simple events.


## Use Cases and the Functional

## Requirements

#####  Use cases are useful tools to clarify user requirements.

#####  Use cases convey only the user’s point of view.

#####  Transforming the user’s view into the developer’s view

##### through functional requirements is one of the system

##### analyst’s key contributions.

#####  The derived functional requirements tell the developers

##### more about what the system must do.

#### second entity in the relationship is the child entity

####  Relationships should have active verb names

####  Relationships go in both directions


## Foreign Keys

######  A relationship implies that instances of one entity are related to

###### instances of another entity

######  The primary key of one entity is migrated into the other entity as a

###### foreignkey.

######  A foreign key is a primary key of one entity that is contributed to

###### (duplicated in) another entity for the purpose of identifying

###### instances of a relationship. A foreign key (always in a child entity)

###### always matches the primary key (in a parent entity).

## Crow’s Foot


## Overview

####  Drawing the ERD is an iterative process of trial and

#### revision

####  ERDs can become quite complex

####  Steps in building ERDs...

###### o Identify the entities

###### o Add appropriate attributes for each entity

###### o Draw the relationships that connect associated entities


## Identify the Entities

####  Identify major categories of information

###### o If available, check the process models for data stores, external

###### entities, and data flows

###### o Check the major inputs and outputs from the use cases

####  Verify that there is more than one instance of the entity

#### that occurs in the system


## Add Appropriate Attributes

#####  Identify attributes of the entity that are relevant to the system

##### under development

o Check the process model repository entries for details on data flows

and data stores

o Check the data requirements of the requirements definition

o Interview knowledgeable users

o Perform document analysis on existing forms and reports

#####  Select the entity’s candidate identifier (final decision may be

##### postponed until Design phase)


## Draw the Relationships

####  Start with an entity and identify all entities with which it

#### shares relationships

####  Describe the relationship with the appropriate verb phrase

####  Determine the cardinality and modality by discussing the

#### business rules with knowledgeable users


## Advanced Syntax - Intersection Entities

####  A new entity is created to store information about two

#### entities sharing an M:N relationship

###### o Remove the M:N relationship between two entities and insert

###### new entity between them

###### o Create two 1 :N relationships: original entities are parents to the

###### new child intersection entity

###### o Name the intersection entity

###### o Migrate parent entity primary keys to new entity as foreign keys

###### (possibly also concatenated primary key)

####  Create an alternative matrix.


# Transition from

# Requirements to Design

BR IE F P R E V IE W


## Key Ideas

####  In Systems Analysis we figure out...

```
o What the business needs
```
####  In System Design we figure out...

```
o How to build the system that fulfills those needs
```
####  All of the “logical” work from Systems Analysis is

#### converted to the “physical”


## Key Definitions

####  Design phase

```
o Decide how to build the system
o Create system requirements that describe all technical details for
building the system
```
####  System specification

```
o Final deliverable from design phase
o Conveys exactly what system the development team will implement
during the implementation phase
```

## Design Phase Steps

```
 Determine system acquisition strategy (make, buy, or outsource)
 Determine the technical architecture for the system
 Address security concerns and globalization issues
 Make hardware and software selections
 Determine the way that users will interact with the system
(interface, inputs, and outputs)
 Design the programs for the underlying processes
 Design the way data will be stored
 Create final deliverable - the system specification

# System Acquisition

# Strategies

W H AT IS T H E BE S T WAY TO A C Q U IR E T H IS S Y S T E M?


## Ways to Acquire a New System

####  Custom development (build from scratch) in-house

####  Purchase software package (and possibly customize it)

```
o Install on our own computers, or
o Obtain access from a software provider (host)
```
####  Outsource development to third party, who might

```
o Build system from scratch for us, or
o Purchase software for us, customize and install it
```

## Custom Development

PROS

 Get exactlywhat we want
 New system built consistently with
existing technology and standards
 Build and retain technical skills and
function knowledge in-house
 Allows team flexibility and creativity
 Unique solutions created for strategic
advantage

```
CONS
 Requires significant time and effort
 May add to existing backlogs
 May require skills we do not have
 Often costs more
 Often takes more calendar time
 Risk of project failure
```

## Purchased Software

PROS

 No need to “reinvent the wheel” for
common business needs
 Tested, proven product
 Cost savings
 Time savings
 Utilize vendors’ expertise
 Some customization may be possible

```
CONS
 Rarely a perfect fit
 Organizational processes must adapt to
software
 Reliance on vendor for maintenance
and future enhancements
 Won’t develop in-house functional and
technical skills
 Unique needs may go unmet
 May require system integration
```

## Purchased Software

```
 Analyze the vendor as well as the software functionality
 Verify vendor claims with others
 Look carefully at vendor support
 Assess long-term viability of vendor as an on-going business
o A new software company may have a great idea, but can they survive
as a business over the long haul?
o If the vendor is an acquisition target, what will happen to the
product?
```

## Systems Integration

```
 Building systems by combining packages, existing (legacy)
systems, and custom software written for integration
 Integrating data between various parts of the system is the
key challenge
 Many consultants specialize in systems integration
```

## Outsourced Development

PROS

 Hire expertise we don’t have
 May save time and money
 Lower risk

```
CONS
 No opportunity to build in-house
expertise
 Reliance on vendor
 Future options limited
 Security –potential loss of confidential
information
 Performance based on contract terms
```

## Outsourcing

```
 Application service providers (ASP) supply access to
software on a pay-as-you-go basis
 Many applications today are “in the cloud”...
o ASP – provider hosts someone else’s software
o SaaS – software vendor hosts its own software
o Considerable savings – no hosting infrastructure needed; host provides
everything
 Risks include
o Fear of losing confidential information
o Performance
```

## Outsourcing

```
 Hiring an external vendor, developer, or service provider to
supply the system
 Can also obtain custom system created by outsourcer
 Can reduce costs and/or add value (resources, experience)
 Risks include
o Losing confidential information
o Losing control over future development
o Losing learning opportunities
```

## Outsourcing Contracts

####  Time and arrangements

####  Fixed-price

####  Value-added

8 - 17 © 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.


## Outsourcing Guidelines

```
 Keep lines of communication open
 Define and stabilize requirements before signing the contract
 View the relationship as a partnership
 Select vendor, developer, or provider carefully
 Assign someone to manage the relationship
 Don’t outsource what you don’t understand
 Emphasize flexible requirements, long-term relationships,
and short-term contracts

```
 Solicits proposals from vendor, developer, or service provider
 Explains the system to be built and criteria for selecting
among applicants
 Request for Information (RFI) -- a shorter and less detailed
version
 Request for Quote (RFQ) – use when you just need a price
```

## Request for Proposal Contents

```
 Description of desired system
 Special technical needs or circumstances
 Evaluation criteria
 Instructions on how to respond
 Desired schedule
 Other information that will help the submitter to make a more
complete or accurate proposal
```

## Developing an Alternative Matrix

```
 Combine several feasibility analyses into one matrix
 Include technical, economic, and organizational
feasibilities
 Assign weights to indicate the relative importance of
the criteria
 Assign scores to indicate how well the alternative
meets the criteria

## Objective of Architecture Design

```
 Assign the software components of the information
system to the hardware devices of the system in the most
advantageous way.
 The major architectural components of any system are
the software and the hardware.
```

## Architectural Components

```
 Software systems can be divided into four
basic functions:
o Data storage.
o Data access logic: the processing required to access
stored data.
o Application logic: the logic documented in the DFDs,
use cases, and functional requirements.
o Presentation logic: the display of information to the
user and the acceptance of the user’s commands.
```

## Architectural Components (cont’d)

```
 The three primary hardware components:
o Client computers: Input-output devices employed by users (e.g.,
PCs, laptops, handheld and mobile devices, smart phones)
o Servers: Larger multi-user computers used to store software and
data.
o Network: Connects the computers.
```

## Client-Server Architectures

```
 Client-server architectures balance the processing
between client devices and one or more server devices.
 Generally, clients are responsible for the presentation
logic, and
 the server(s) are responsible for the data access logic and
data storage.
 Application logic location varies depending on the C-S
configuration chosen.
```

## Benefits of Client-Server

```
 Scalable
 Can support different types of clients and servers through
middleware.
 The presentation logic, the application logic, and the data
processing logic can be independent.
 If a server fails, only the applications requiring that server
are affected – highly reliable.
```

## Client-Server Tiers

```
 There are many ways in which the application logic can be
partitioned between the client side and the server side.
 The arrangement in Figure 8-1 is called two-tiered
architecture.
```
```
© 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 8 - 10
```

### Two-Tiered

### Client-Server

### Architecture

o Thick client logic on the client side (shown –most of application
here)
o Thin client on the client side; most shifted to –little application logic
server side


### Three-Tiered

### Client-Server

### Architecture

o Adds “specialized” servers for application logic; one for data –one
base tasks


### n-Tiered Client-

### Server

### Architecture

o Adds for Web“specialized-related business logic; one ” servers –one
for application logic; one for data base tasks


## Adding “Tiers” in the Architecture

ADVANTAGES

 Modular business logic components are
shareable across applications
 Separating the processing among
multiple servers makes it possible to
balance the server loads efficiently.

```
DISADVANTAGES
 More tiers place a higher load on the
network.
 More difficult to implement since the
servers must communicate effectively.
```

### Server-Based

### Architecture

Zerodesktop infrastructure (VDI)-client used today in virtual


## Mobile Application Architecture

```
 Rich client – involves processing on the mobile device using
its resources. Presentation logic, business logic, and data
access logic on the client side.
 Thin Web-based client – business and data access logic on the
server side; always connected to server.
 Rich Internet application – browser-based; uses some
technologies on client device to provide a rich user interface
(e.g., Flash).
```

## Mobile Application Options

```
 Native app – written to run on specific device with specific
operating system.
 Cross-platform frameworks – develop in web-based
technologies and use framework to deploy to multiple
devices.
 Mobile Web app – browser-based; platform independent.
Most limited user experience.
```

## Advances in Architecture Configurations

```
 Advances in hardware, software, and networking have given
rise to a number of new architecture options.
o Virtualization: Creation of a virtual device or resource.
o Cloud computing: Computing resources obtained as a service.
```

## Virtualization

```
 Server virtualization involves partitioning a physical server
into smaller virtual servers.
 Storage virtualization involves combining multiple network
storage devices into what appears to be single storage unit.
```

## Cloud Computing

```
 Cloud computing – everything from computing power to
computing infrastructure, applications, business processes
to personal collaboration can be delivered as a service
wherever and whenever needed.
 The “cloud” can be defined as the set of hardware,
networks, storage, devices, and interfaces that combine to
deliver aspects of computing as a service.
```

## Advantages of Cloud Computing

```
 Elasticity: the resources allocated can be increased or
decreased quickly, based on demand.
 Cloud customers can obtain cloud resources in a
straightforward fashion.
 Cloud services typically have standardized APIs
(application program interfaces).
 Customers are billed for resources as they are used.
```

## Comparing Architecture Options

```
 Most systems are built to use the existing infrastructure in
the organization, so often the current infrastructure
restricts the choice of architecture.
 Each of the architectures discussed has its strengths and
weaknesses.
 Client-server architectures are strongly favored on the
basis of the cost of infrastructure.
 Cloud computing deserves consideration today.

# User Interface Design

S Y S T E M S A N A LY S I S A N D D E S IG N , 6TH E D IT I O N
D E N N IS , W IX O M, A N D R O T H


## Learning Objectives

 Explain the concept of usability with regard to the user interface.
 Describe several fundamental user interface design principles.
 Discuss special concerns associated with touch-screen-enabled
user interfaces.


## Key Definitions

 System Interface: “connections” with other systems, where
systems exchange information with each other. Designed as a part
of program design.
 User Interface: “connections” with users. Focus of this chapter.
o The navigation mechanism provides the way for users to tell the system
what to do
o The input mechanism defines the way the system captures information
o The output mechanism defines the way the system provides information to
users or other systems


## Key Definitions, con’t.

 Graphical user interface (GUI): most common type of interface in
use today.
 User Experience (UX): the art of planning a product’s design so
that that the interactions with the completed project are as positive
as possible. (source: [http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/UX-user-experience)](http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/UX-user-experience))
 Usability: Pertaining to the design of a system to make it easy to
use and easy to learn.


## Usability Concept

 The system is easy to use and easy to learn
 Tasks are completed more efficiently and with more accuracy
 Mistakes with system are reduced
 User satisfaction with new system is increased
 Adoption of system is more likely


# Interface Design

# Principles

G E N E R A L G U ID E L I N E S FO R U S E R IN T E R FA C E D E S IG N


## Principles for User Interface Design

 Layout
 Content awareness
 Aesthetics
 Usage level
 Consistency
 Minimize user effort


## Layout Concepts

#####  The screen is often divided into three boxes

```
o Navigation area (top)
o Status area (bottom)
o Work area (middle)
```
#####  Information can be presented in multiple areas

#####  Like areas should be grouped together



## More Layout Concepts

 Areas and information should minimize user movement from one
to another
 Ideally, areas will remain consistent in
o Size
o Shape
o Placement for entering data
o Reports presenting retrieved data


#### Model Layout

#### for Web Page

o Note use of multiple layout areas for site navigation


## Content Awareness

######  All interfaces should have titles

######  Menus should show

###### owhere you are

###### owhere you came from to get there

######  It should be clear what information is within each

###### area

######  Fields and field labels should be selected carefully

######  Use dates and version numbers to aid system users


#### Content

#### Awareness

o Note the use of highlighting to indicate menu selections

o Breadcrumbs provide additional clues on navigational path



### Aesthetics

#####  Interfaces need to be functional and inviting to use

#####  Avoid squeezing in too much, particularly for novice users

#####  Design text carefully

```
oBe aware of font and size
oAvoid using all capital letters
```

## More Aesthetics

#####  Colors and patterns should be used carefully

```
oContrast, readability
oUse colors to separate or categorize items
```
#####  Color Pallet Planning

```
o http://paletton.com
```

## Usage Level

 Some people will be frequent, heavy users of the system
 Frequent users desire ease of use – quick and easy completion of
job tasks
 Other people may use the system infrequently
 Infrequent users desire ease of learning – quick and easy ways to
figure out what to do.


## Usage Level

 User interface design should anticipate the types of users expected.
 For systems primarily used by frequent users, include ways to
perform tasks directly (hot keys, short-cut keys, etc.).
 For systems primarily used by infrequent users, include careful
menu designs, tool tips, and extensive help systems.
 For systems with both user types, incorporate both user preferences
in design as much as possible


## Consistency

######  Elements are the same throughout the application

######  Enables users to predict what will happen

######  Reduces learning curve

######  Considers elements within an application and across

###### applications

######  Pertains to many different levels

```
o Navigation controls
o Terminology
o Report and form design
```

#### Example of

#### Inconsistent

#### Elements

Note the different button styles, colors, and font styles.


## Minimize Effort

 Three clicks rule
o Users should be able to go from the start or main menu of a system to the
information or action they want in no more than three mouse clicks or
three keystrokes


## Special Issues of Touch Screen Design

 Ideal for information display but not data entry.
 Place content at top and navigation controls at bottom so finger
does not obscure content area.
 Place labels on top of navigation controls.
 Size objects correctly for “fat fingers.”
 Include adequate spacing between objects.


## Special Issues of Touch Screen Design,

## con’t.

 Consider needs of left-handed and right-handed users.

## Understand the Users

 Users likely will have very different goals and intentions when
using the system.
 Use personas to develop characterizations of various user groups.
o Interests
o Typical behaviors
o Goals and objectives
o Expectations
 Plan a user interface that will be satisfying for that particular user
group.


### Personas for

### Tune Source


## Understand the Users, con’t.

 Use scenarios outline the steps that the users perform to
accomplish some part of their work.
 Presented in a simple narrative tied to the related DFD.
 Document the most common paths through the use case so
interface designs will be easy to use for those situations.


### Use Scenarios

consistency:
o Basic common elements across individual screens, forms, and reports
within the application
o Interface metaphor (e.g., calendar, checkbook, shopping cart)
o Interface objects (e.g., customer/client; employee/associate)
o Interface actions (e.g., buy/purchase/check out; exit/quit)
o Interface icons (pictures) representing status or actions (e.g., trashcan for
delete; disk for save)
o Interface templates (layout guide for all screens)

# Navigation Design

P R O V ID I N G A S E A M LE S S IN T E R A C T I O N


## Basic Principles of Navigation Design

####  Assume users

```
o Have not read the manual
o Have not attended training
o Do not have external help readily at hand
```
####  All controls should be clear and understandable and placed

#### in an intuitive location on the screen.


## Basic Principles of Navigation Design

####  Prevent mistakes

```
oLimit choices
oNever display commands that can’t be used (or “gray them
out”)
oConfirm actions that are difficult or impossible to undo
```
####  Simplify recovery from mistakes

####  Use consistent grammar order (action-object, object-

#### action)


## Menu Tips

 Menus enable users to select action from an organized display of
action categories and options
 Broad and shallow design is preferred
 Logical categories can be objects (customers; orders) or actions
(insert, design)
 Common menu formats include menu bars, drop-down menus,
popup menus, tab menus, icon tool bars, and image maps.
 Menus may become less popular with trend toward touchscreens


## Message Tips

 Common message types include:
oError message
oConfirmation message
oAcknowledgment message
oDelay message
oHelp message
 Strive for clear, concise, and complete messages
 Should be grammatically correct and free of jargon and abbreviations
(unless they are the users’)
 Avoid negatives and humor (it gets old)


# Input Design

E N T E R IN G N E W D ATA IN TO T H E S Y S T E M


## Basic Principles of Input Design

 The goal is to simply and easily capture accurate information for
the system
 Reflect the nature of the inputs
 Find ways to simplify their collection


## Online versus Batch Processing

####  Online processing immediately records the transaction in

#### the appropriate database

####  Batch processing collects inputs over time, holds them

#### temporarily, and then processes all the transactions at one

#### time in a batch

####  Batch processing simplifies data communications and

#### other processes; but master files are not updated real time


## Capture Data at the Source

 Reduces duplicate work
 Reduces processing time
 Decreases cost
 Decreases probability of error


## Source Data Automation

 Can be obtained by using the following technologies:
obar code readers / scanners
ooptical character recognition
omagnetic stripe readers
osmart cards
oRFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags


## Minimize Keystrokes

 Keyboard entry is slow and error-prone
 Never ask for information that can be obtained other ways
o Lookups
o Dropdown lists
o Default values


### Input Tips

Utilize selection controls whenever possible to minimize keystrokes.


## Input Validation

 Apply a judicious amount of input validation to ensure accuracy.
 Types include:
o Completeness check
o Format check
o Range check
o Check digit check
o Consistency check
o Database checks


# Output Design

C O N V E Y IN G T H E IN F O R M AT I O N T H E U S E R N E E D S


## Basic Output Design Principles

 Understand report usage
o Reference or cover-to-cover?
o Frequency?
o Real-time or batch reports?
 Manage information load
o All needed information, no more
 Minimize bias
 Utilize various report types (detail, summary, exception, graphical)
and media to satisfy users’ output requirements.

# Designing Programs


## Key Definitions

 Program design - creating instructions for the programmers
 The top-down, modular approach - begin with the “big picture”
and gradually add detail
 Program design document – all structure charts and specifications
needed by programmers to implement the system


## The Structure Chart

 Important program design technique
 Shows all components of code in a hierarchical format
o Sequence
o Selection
o Iteration
 Illustrates the organization and interactions of the different
program modules


### Example

### Structure Chart


## Structure Chart Elements

```
Calculate1.
Current GPA
```
```
Module
```
```
Get Student1.
Grade Record
```
```
Library Module
```
```
Loop
```
```
Conditional Line
```
```
Control Couple
```
```
Data Couple
```
```
PageOff
```
```
pageOn
```

## Building the Structure Chart

####  Processes in the DFD tend to represent one module on the

#### structure chart

```
oAfferent processes – provide inputs to system
oCentral processes – perform critical system operations
oEfferent processes – handle system outputs
```
####  The DFD leveling can correspond to the structure chart

#### hierarchy


## Types of Structure Charts

 Transaction structure – control module calls subordinate modules,
each of which handles a particular transaction
o Few afferent processes
o Many efferent processes
o Higher up levels of structure chart
o Concerned with coordinating the production of outputs


### Transaction

### Structure


## Types of Structure Charts, con’t.

####  Transform structure – control module calls several

#### subordinate modules in sequence

####  Each subordinate performs a step in a process that

#### transforms an input into an output

```
oMany afferent processes
oFew efferent processes
oLower levels of structure chart
oConcerned with using inputs to create a new output
```

### Transform

### Structure


## Steps in Building the Structure Chart

1. Identify top level modules and decompose them into lower levels
2. Add control connections
3. Add couples
4. Review and revise again and again until complete


## Design Guidelines

 High quality structure charts result in programs that are modular,
reusable and easy to implement.
 Measures include:
o Cohesion
o Coupling
o Appropriate levels of fan-in and fan-out


## Types of Cohesion

 Functional
 Sequential
 Communicational
 Procedural
 Temporal
 Logical
 Coincidental

```
Good
```
```
Bad
```

## Factoring

 Process of dealing with “low” cohesion
 Separates tasks into different modules
 Reduces use of control flags


## Types of Coupling

 Data
 Stamp
 Control
 Common
 Content

```
Good
```
```
Bad
```

## Fan-in

#### High fan-in preferred

#### Promotes reuse of subordinate modules

```

EmployeeSalary
Print1.2
EmployeeRoster
Calculate1.3
Benefits
```
```
1.1.2Read
EmployeeRecord

```
```
1.2.1Read
EmployeeRecord
```
```
1.3.1Read
EmployeeRecord
```
#### Low fan-in not preferred


## Quality Checklist

1. Library modules have been created where ever possible
2. The diagram has a high fan-in structure
3. Control modules have no more than 7 subordinates
4. Each module performs only one function (high cohesion)
5. Modules sparingly share information (loose coupling)
6. Data couples that are passed are actually used by the accepting module
7. Control couples are passed from “low to high”
8. Each module has a reasonable amount of code associated with it

Learning Objectives
```
 Become familiar with several file and database formats.

 Describe several goals of data storage.

 Be able to revise a logical ERD into a physical ERD.

 Be able to optimize a relational database for data storage and data

```
access.
```
 Become familiar with indexes.

 Be able to estimate the size of a database.


```
Key Concepts
```
 Data storage function: how data is stored and handled

```
by programs that run the system.
```
 Data storage design:

```
o select the data storage format;
```
```
o convert the logical data model into a physical data model to
```
```
reflect implementation decisions;
```
```
o ensure that DFDs and ERDs balance; and
```
```
o design the selected data storage format to optimize its
```
```
processing efficiency.
```

Data Storage Formats

S E LE C T IN G T H E BE S T S TO R A G E O P T IO N


DATA STORAGE FORMATS

 Types of data storage formats:

```
o Files:electronic lists of data, optimized to perform a
```
```
particular transaction.
```
```
o Database:a collection of groupings of information that are
```
```
related to each other in some way.
```
 Database Management System (DBMS):

```
software that creates and manipulates the
```
```
databases.
```

Files

```
 Data file: an electronic list of information
```
```
that is formatted for a particular transaction.
```
```
 Sequential organization is typical.
```
```
 Record associations with other records
```
```
created by pointers.
```
```
 Also called linked lists because of the way
```
```
the records are linked together using
```
```
pointers.
```

```
Types of Files
```
 Master files – store core information that is

```
important to the application.
```
 Look-up files – contain static values.

 Transaction files – store information that can

```
be used to update a master file.
```
 Audit files – record “before” and “after” images

```
of data as the data is altered.
```
 History files (or archive files) – store past

```
transactions.
```

File Example


```
Databases
```
 There are many types of databases:

```
o Legacy database
```
```
o Relational database
```
```
o Object database
```
```
o Multidimensional database
```
```
o NoSQL database
```

```
Legacy Databases
```
 Databases which are based on older

```
technology; seldom used to develop new
```
```
applications.
```
 Two major types:

```
o Hierarchical databases use hierarchies, or inverted trees, to
```
```
represent relationships.
```
```
o Network databases are collections of records that are
```
```
related to each other through pointers.
```

Hierarchical & Network Databases


Relational Databases

```
 The most popular kind of database for
```
```
application development today.
```
```
 Based on collections of tables, each of
```
```
which has a primary key.
```
```
 Tables are related to each other by the
```
```
placing the primary key from one table into
```
```
the related table as a foreign key.
```

Relational Databases, con’t.

```
 Most relational database management systems
```
```
(RDBMS) support referential integrity;
```
```
ensures that values linking the tables together
```
```
are valid and correctly synchronized.
```
```
 Structured Query Language (SQL) is the
```
```
standard language for accessing the data in the
```
```
tables.
```

Appointment

Database


Object Databases

```
 Based on object orientation: that all things should
```
```
be treated as objects that have both data
```
```
(attributes) and processes (behaviors).
```
```
 Object-oriented database management system
```
```
(OODBMS) are mainly used to support
```
```
multimedia applications or systems that
```
```
involve complex data.
```
```
 Play a minor role in the DBMS market at this
```
```
time.
```

Multidimensional Databases

```
 A type of relational database used extensively in data
```
```
warehousing.
```
```
 Data warehousing is the practice of taking and
```
```
storing data in a data warehouse (i.e., a large
```
```
database) that supports business intelligence (BI)
```
```
systems.
```
```
 Data marts are smaller databases based on data
```
```
warehouse data; support BI for specific departments
```
```
or functional areas of the organization.
```

Multidimensional Databases, con’t.

```
Stores data to support aggregations of
```
```
data on multiple dimensions.
```
```
When the data are first loaded into a
```
```
multidimensional database, the database
```
```
precalculates the data across the multiple
```
```
dimensions and stores the answers for fast
```
```
access.
```

Multidimensional

Database


```
NoSQL Databases
```
 Newest database approach; not based on the relational model or SQL.

 Rapid processing on replicated database servers in the cloud.

 Various types include:

```
o Document-oriented databases: manage collection of documents of varying forms
```
```
and structures (e.g., Mongo DB)
```
```
o Wide column databases: store data in records holding very large numbers of
```
```
dynamic columns (potentially billions of columns). E.g., Bigtable, Cassandra,
```
```
Dynamo
```
```
o Graph databases: a collection of nodes and edges using graph theory to store,
```
```
map, and query relationships.
```

Selecting a Storage Format

```
 Each of the file and database data storage format has
```
```
its strengths and weaknesses.
```
```
 Factors to consider in selecting a storage format:
```
```
o Data Types
```
```
o Type of Application System
```
```
o Existing Storage Formats
```
```
o Future Needs
```

A D D IN G IM P LE M E N TAT I O N D E TA ILS


Transforming the Logical Data Model

 The logical entity relationship diagrams (ERD) depicts the

```
“business view” of the data; omits implementation details.
```
 Having determined the data storage format, physical data

```
models are created to show implementation details and to
```
```
explain more about the “how” of the final system.
```

The Physical ERD

```
 The physical ERD includes entities, relationships, and
```
```
attributes.
```
```
 Adds references to how data will be stored.
```
```
 Much more metadata is defined.

Summary of

Normalization

Steps

```
© 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 33
```

```
Optimizing Access Speed
```
 After optimizing for data storage efficiency, data are

```
spread out across a number of tables.
```
 For a large relational database, it is necessary to optimize

```
access speed.
```
 Techniques of optimizing access speed:

```
o Denormalization
```
```
o Clustering
```
```
o Indexing
```
```
o Estimating the size of data for hardware planning
```

```
Denormalization
```
 Add redundancy back into the design.

 Reduce the number of joins required during processing to

```
enhance data access speed.
```

```
Clustering
```
Placing records together physically so that like

```
records are stored close together.
```
Intrafile clustering: Similar records in the table are

```
stored together.
```
Interfile clustering: Combining records from more

```
than one table that typically are retrieved together.
```

```
Indexing
```
A data storage index is a minitable (similar to an

```
index of a book) containing values from one or
```
```
more columns in a table and the location of the
```
```
values within the table.
```
Indexes require overhead; they take up storage

```
space.
```

Index

Illustration


```
Indexing Guidelines
```
 Use indexes sparingly for transaction systems.

 Use many indexes to improve response times in business

```
intelligence systems.
```
 For each table, create a unique index that is based on the primary

```
key.
```
 For each table, create an index that is based on the foreign key to

```
improve the performance of joins.
```
 Create an index for fields that are used frequently for grouping,

```
sorting, or criteria.
```

```
Estimating Storage Size
```
 Volumetrics – technique of estimating the amount

```
of data that the hardware must support.
```
1. Calculate the amount of raw data - all the data stored

```
within the database tables.
```
2. Calculate the overhead requirements based on the

```
DBMS vendor’s recommendations.
```
3. Record the number of initial records loaded into the

```
table, as well as the expected growth per month.
```

## Learning Objectives

```
 Be familiar with the system construction process.
 Explain different types of tests and when to use them.
 Describe how to develop user documentation.
```

## Key Definitions

######  Implementation is the development of all parts of the

###### system: the software itself, documentation, and new

###### operating procedures.


# Managing the

# Programming Process

P R O J E C T M A N A G E M E N T D U R IN G C O N S T R U C T IO N


## Project Manager’s Tasks During

## Programming

######  Assigning the programmers

######  Coordinating the activities

######  Managing the schedule


## The Programmer Paradox

######  More is not always better than less!

######  After the “right” number of people are assigned to a

###### programming task, adding more people slows down

###### rather than speeds up completion of the project.

######  Projects requiring a large team should be broken into a

###### series of independent, smaller parts.


## Assigning Programmers

```
Minimize the number of programmers
```
```
Two communicationchannels
```
```
Twelve communicationchannels
```
o Match programming tasks with programmer capabilities
o When skills are deficient, apply mentoring and training


## Coordinating Activities

######  Weekly (hopefully brief) meetings

######  Create and follow standards

######  Organize programmers’ work areas

```
o Development area
o Testing area
o Production area
```
######  Implement change control mechanisms

######  Use program log to monitor program changes


## Managing the Schedule

######  Use initial time estimates as a baseline

######  Revise time estimates as construction proceeds

######  Fight against scope creep

######  Monitor “minor” slippage

######  Create risk assessment and track changing risks

######  Fight the temptation to lower quality to meet

###### unreasonable schedule demands


## Avoid Classic Mistakes

###### Research-oriented development

```
If you use state-of-the art technology, lengthen planned time
```
###### Using “low-cost” personnel

```
If using a significant number of entry level personnel, lengthen
planned time
```
###### Lack of code control

```
Use source code library to keep programmers from changing the
same code at the same time
```
###### Inadequate testing

```
Always allocate sufficient time for formal testing
```

# Testing

E N S U R IN G T H E S Y S T E M FU LF I L L S R E Q U IR E M E N T S


## Testing Philosophy

```
 Testing helps ensure that the system performs as outlined in the
specifications.
 It is dangerous to test early modules without an overall testing
plan
 It may be difficult to reproduce sequence of events causing an
error
 Testing must be done systematically and results documented
carefully
```

#### Test Plan

```
Roberta M. Roth © 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 13
```

## Categories of Testing

```
 Stub testing
o Tests control structures before all modules are written
 Unit testing
o Tests each module – Does it performs its function?
 Integration testing
o Tests the interaction of modules - do they work together?
 System testing
o Tests to assure that the software works well as part of the overall system
 Acceptance testing
o Tests to assure that the system serves organizational needs

```

## System Testing

```
 Requirements Testing
o Ensures that integration did not cause new errors
 Usability Testing
o Tests how easy and error-free the system is in use
 Security Testing
o Assures that security functions are handled properly
 Performance Testing
o Assures that the system works under high volumes of
activity (e.g., simultaneous users, peak transaction volume)
 Documentation Testing
o Analysts check the accuracy of documentation
```

## Acceptance Testing

```
 Alpha Testing
o Performed by users to assure they accept the system; frequently repeats
earlier tests
 Beta Testing
o Uses real data, not test data. Actual users monitor for errors or needed
improvements.
 User sign-off following Acceptance Testing indicates the
system is ready to be placed into production.
```

# Developing

# Documentation

C R E AT IN G G O O D D O C U M E N TAT I O N


## Types of Documentation

```
 Documentation provides information to make the system
easier to use and repair.
 System Documentation
o Intended to help programmers and analysts understand and maintain the
system after it is installed
 User Documentation
o Intended to help users operate the system
```

## Producing Documentation

```
 High quality documentation takes about 3 hours per page or 2
hours per screen.
 The task should not be left to the end of the project.
 Time required to develop and test user documentation should
be built into project plan.
 On-line documentation is predominant today.
```

## Value of Online Documentation

```
 Searching is simplified.
 Information can be presented in multiple formats.
 New methods of interacting with documentation are possible
(e.g., tool tips, animated demos, narrated demos).
 Less costly than paper documentation.
```

## Types of User Documentation

```
 Reference documents (perform system functions).
 Procedures manuals (perform business tasks – includes
manual procedures).
 Tutorials (how to use system components).
```

### Sources of Documentation Topics

```
 Users’ business tasks (what they need to do)
 The commands and menus in the user interface
 Definitions of terms
```

### Guidelines for Crafting

### Documentation Topics

 Don’t omit any step because you “assume” the user knows
how to do that step

 Use the active voice with direct instructions

 Use consistent terms

 Use simple, friendly language

 Use parallel grammatical structure

 Use steps correctly (as actions)

 Use short paragraphs

## Learning Objectives

```
 Explain the system installation process.
 Describe the elements of a migration plan.
 Explain different types of conversion strategies and when
to use them.
 Describe several techniques for managing change.
 Outline postinstallation processes.

# Making the Transition

# to the New System

S M O O T H IN G T H E PAT H


## Key Ideas

```
 Transitioning to new systems involves managing change
from pre-existing norms and habits.
 Change management involves:
oUnfreezing -- loosening up peoples’ habits and norms
oMoving -- transition from old to new systems
oRefreezing -- institutionalize and make efficient the new
way of doing things
```

### Implementing

### Change


# Migration Planning

G U ID I N G T H E P R O C E S S


## Migration Planning

```
 What activities will be performed when and by whom
o Technical aspects
 Installing hardware and software
 Converting data
o Organizational aspects
 Training users on the system
 Motivating employees to use the new system to aid in their work
```

## Elements of a Migration Plan


## Business Contingency Plan

```
 What do we do if things go very wrong during
conversion?
o Technical glitches may occur during the transition
o Is the old system still available?
o If not, how do we keep the business running?
o Can manual procedures be used for a short time?
 Be prepared for the worst case scenario!
o Think about the consequences of being unable to operate
normally...lost sales, unhappy customers... could we stay afloat?
```

### Conversion

### Strategies


## Conversion Styles

```
 Direct conversion
o The new system instantly replaces the old
 Parallel conversion
o For a time both old and new systems are used. The old is abandoned
when the new is proven fully capable.
```

## Conversion Location

```
 Pilot conversion
o One or more locations are converted to work out bugs before
extending to other locations
 Phased conversion
o Locations are converted in sets
 Simultaneous conversion
o All locations are converted at the same time
```

## Conversion Modules

```
 Whole system conversion
o All modules converted in one step
 Modular conversion
o When modules are loosely associated, they can be converted one at a
time
```

## Determining a Conversion Strategy:

## Risk

```
 To minimize risk...
o Parallel conversion style
o Pilot conversion location
o Conversion by modules
 Riskiest conversion strategy:
o Direct conversion style
o Simultaneous conversion location
o Conversion of whole system
```

## Determining a conversion strategy:

## Cost

```
 To minimize cost...
o Direct conversion style
o Pilot or phased conversion location
o Conversion of whole system
 Highest cost conversion strategy:
o Parallel conversion style
o Simultaneous conversion location
o Conversion of modules
```

## Determining a Conversion Strategy:

## Time

```
 To minimize time...
o Direct conversion style
o Simultaneous conversion location
o Conversion of whole system
 Longest time conversion strategy:
o Parallel conversion style
o Phased conversion location
o Conversion of modules
```

# Change Management

P R E PA R IN G T H E P E O P LE FO R T H E N E W S Y S T E M


## Key Roles in Change Management

```
 The sponsor is the business person who initiated the
request for the new system
 The change agent is the person(s) who lead the change
effort
 The potential adopter(s) are the people who must change.
```

## Steps in Change Management

1. Revise management policies
2. Assess costs and benefits models of potential adopters
3. Motivate adoption
4. Enable people to adopt


## Understanding Resistance to Change

```
 Even changes that benefit an organization do not
necessarily benefit each individual
 Adapting to new work processes requires effort, for
which there may be no additional compensation
```

### The Costs and

### Benefits of

### Change


## Revising Management Policies

```
 No computer system will be successfully adopted unless
management policies support its adoption
 Management tools for supporting adoption
o Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
o Measurements and rewards
o Resource allocation
```

## Change Management Planning

```
 Develop strategies to motivate adoption
o Informational - aims to convince adopters that change is better
o Political - uses organizational power to motivate change
o Potential adopters generally are
 20 - 30 % Ready adopters
 20 - 30 %Resistant adopters
 40 - 60 %Reluctant adopters
 Strategies should focus on supporting and encouraging ready adopters
and helping them win over the reluctantadopters.
 ‘Ignore’ the resistant adopters
```

## Training

```
 Every new system requires new skills
 New skills may involve use of the technology itself
 New skills may be needed to handle the changed business
processes
```

## What to Train

```
 IT specialists tend to focus training around system
features
 Should focus on helping users accomplish their tasks
 Use scenarios provide an outline for common activities
and a basis to plan training
```

## Types of Training

```
 Classroom
 One-on-one
 Computer-based

# Basic OO

# Characteristics


## What is “object-oriented”?

 The object-oriented approach views a system as a collection of
self-contained objects, including both data and processes.
 Object-oriented systems focus on capturing the structure and
behavior of information systems in modules (objects) that
encompass both data and processes.


## Classes and Objects

######  Class: the general template used to define and create

###### specific instances, or objects.

######  An object: an instantiation of a class. An object is a

###### person, place, event, or thing about which we want to

###### capture information.

######  Each object has attributes that describe information about

###### the object.


## Classes and Objects (cont’d)


## Messages and Methods

 Methods implement an object’s behavior.
 A method is an action that an object can perform.
 Messages are information sent to objects to trigger methods.


## Messages and Methods, con’t.


## Encapsulation and Information Hiding

 Encapsulation: the combining of process and data into a single
entity.
 Information hiding: only the information required to use a software
module be published to the user of the module.


## Inheritance

#### Inheritance is used to identify higher level, or more

#### general, classes of objects.

#### Common sets of attributes and methods can be

#### organized into superclasses.

#### Classes are arranged in a hierarchy whereby the

#### superclasses, or general classes, are at the top, and

#### subclasses, or specific classes, are at the bottom.


#### Inheritance


## Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding

 Polymorphism means that the same message can be interpreted

```
differently by different classes of objects.
```
 Made possible through dynamic binding: a technique that delays

```
identifying the type of object until run-time.
```
 Contrast to static binding in which the type of object would be

```
determined at compile time.
```

#### Polymorphism

#### and

#### Encapsulation


# OO Systems Analysis

# and Design

T H E OO A P P R O A C H


## Background

#####  Most object-oriented approaches are associated with an

##### iterative development RAD methodology.

#####  The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard set

##### of diagramming techniques for object-oriented systems

##### analysis and design.


## Background, con’t.

```
 Any object-oriented approach to developing information
systems must be:
ouse case driven – use cases are the primary modeling tool;
oarchitecture centric – the underlying architecture of the evolving
system drives the specification, construction, and documentation of the
system; and
oiterative and incremental – the development undergoes continuous
testing throughout the life of the project.
```

## Benefits of an Object Approach

 Analysts break a complex system into small manageable
components
 Work on the components individually
 Easily piece the components back together to form a system
 Modularity makes system development easier to grasp
 Modules easier to share among members of a project team


## Benefits of an Object Approach

 Reusable pieces are created that can be plugged into other systems
efforts or used as starting points for other projects
 Save time; new projects do not have to start from scratch and
learning curves are not as steep
 “Object think” is a much more realistic way to think about the real
world


### UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE

### VERSION 2.

 The objective of the Unified Modeling Language is to provide a

```
common vocabulary of object-oriented terms and diagramming
techniques.
```
 The diagrams are broken into two major groupings:
o Structure diagrams - for representing data and static relationships;
o Behavior diagrams - for representing dynamic relationships among the
objects.


#### The Rational

#### Unified Phased

#### Develoment

#### Process


## Four Fundamental UML Diagrams

 Four UML diagramming techniques dominate the object-oriented
projects:
o Use case diagrams,
o Class diagrams,
o Sequence diagrams, and
o Behavior state machine diagrams.


#### Integration of

#### the Four UML

#### Diagrams


# Use Case Diagram

FO U N D AT I O N O F U M L D IA G R A M S


## USE CASE DIAGRAM

 A use case diagram summarizes all of the use cases (for the part of
the system being modeled) together in one picture
 use case diagram elements:
oActor
oName
oSystem Boundary
oAssociation Relationship


#### Use Case

#### Diagram


###### Use Case Diagram

###### with Extends and

###### Includes

###### Associations


## Creating a Use Case Diagram

 Steps in creating a use case diagram
1. Identify use cases.
2. Draw the system boundary.
3. Place the use cases on the diagram.
4. Identify the actors.
5. Add association relationships.



# Class Diagram

A S TAT IC V IE W O F C LA S S E S


## CLASS DIAGRAM

 The class diagram is a static model
 Shows the classes and the relationships among the classes.
 Elements of diagram include:
oClasses
oAttributes
oMethods
oAssociations
Class is the main building block of a class diagram, which stores and manages
information in the system.


## (cont’d)

 Operations are actions or functions that a class can perform.
 There are three kinds of operations: constructor, query, and
update.
 Associations represent the relationships that classes have with one
another.
 Associations also have multiplicity, which shows how an instance
of an object can be associated with other instances.



#### Multiplicity


## Generalization and Aggregation

 Generalization shows that one class (subclass) inherits from
another class (superclass).
 Aggregation is used when classes actually comprise other classes.


## Simplifying Class Diagram

 When the class diagram become very complex, it is sometimes

```
necessary to simplify the diagram by using a view to limit the
amount of information displayed.
```
 Another approach to simplifying class diagram is through the use

```
of package (i.e., logical groups of classes).
```

## Creating a Class Diagram

 Steps in creating a class diagram:

1. Identify classes.
2. Identify attributes and operations.
3. Draw associations between the classes,

######  a generic sequence diagram shows all possible scenarios

###### of a use case,

######  A set of instance sequence diagrams are usually

###### developed, each of which depicts a single scenario within

## Behavioral State Machine Diagram

######  A dynamic model showing the different states that a

###### single class passes through during its life in response to

###### events, along with its responses and actions.
