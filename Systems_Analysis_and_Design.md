Describe technical, economic, and organizational feasibility assessment.
Be able to perform a feasibility analysis.


###### Estimating

###### Business Value

o Identify sources: increased sales;
decreased costs; reduced
headcount; lower turnover...
o Assign values as initial estimates
Click to add text


## Feasibility Analysis

######  Detailed business case for the project

```
o Technical feasibility
o Economic feasibility
o Organizational feasibility
```
######  Compiled into a feasibility study

######  Critically important to reassess feasibility

###### throughout the project


## Technical Feasibility: Can We Build It?

```
 Sources of Technical Risk:
o Users’ and analysts’ lack of familiarity with the business application
area
o Lack of familiarity with technology
▪ Have we used it before? How new is it?
o Project size
▪ Number of people, time frame, distinct features
o Compatibility with existing systems
▪ Degree of integration required
```

## Economic Feasibility: Should We Build

## It?

#####  Identify costs and benefits

#####  Assign values to costs and benefits

#####  Determine cash flow

#####  Assess financial viability

```
o Return on investment
o Break even point
o Net present value
```

###### Costs and

###### Benefits

o Include development and
operational costs
o Consider tangible and intangible
benefits


## Economic Feasibility Measures

###  Return on Investment (ROI)

 ROI = (Total Benefits – Total Costs) / Total Costs

###  Break Even Point (BEP) or Payback Period

####  PEB = # Neg Yrs + (Net Cash flow-

#### Cumulative Cash Flow)/(Net Cash Flow)


## Economic Feasibility Measures

###  Present Value (PV)

```
 PV = (Cash Flow)/( 1 + Rate of Return)
n
```
###  Net Present Value (NPV)

####  NPV = ∑ PV Total Benefits - ∑ PV Total

#### Costs


## Practice - ROI

It’s estimated that a new project will cost $150,000 in development
costs, and $50,000 in operational costs each year for three years. It’s
estimated that it will create $110,000 in benefits each year in the
same three years. What is the ROI?
ROI = (Total Benefits – Total Costs) / (Total Costs)
Total Costs = $150,000 + ( 3 X $50,000) = $300,
Total Benefits = 3 X $110,000 = $330,
ROI = ($330,000 - $300,000)/ $300,
ROI = 10 %


## Practice - BEP

```
BEP= Yrsof NegCash Flow
+ (That year net cash flow –That year
cumulative cash flow)/(That year net cash
flow)
= 3 + ((534,149-338,670)/534,149)
= 3 + (195,479/534,149)
= 3 +. 37
=3.37 years
```

## Practice - PV

```
 PV = (Cash Flow)/( 1 + Rate of Return)
n
 $ 100 paid to you in three years
 Rate of return available 10 %
 PV = 100 /( 1 +. 1 )
3
 PV = 100 / 1.
3
 PV = 100 /1.331 = 75.
```

###### Cost-Benefit

###### Analysis

o Discounted cash flow method
preferred
o NPV preferred


## Organizational Feasibility:

## If We Build It, Will They Come?

```
 Strategic alignment
o Are project goals aligned with business strategy?
 Evaluate effect on various stakeholders
o Strong and influential project champion?
o Strong and widespread organizational management support?
o Receptive / resistant system users?
```

## Organizational Feasibility

## If We Build It, Will They Come?

```
 Strategic alignment
o Close alignment with strategy increases the likelihood of success
 Stakeholder groups can be influenced
o Presentations describing and promoting benefits
o Emphasizing personal benefits as well as organizational benefits
o Prototypes help prove the system concept
o Real user involvement throughout project
```

## Feasibility Assessment: Summing It Up

```
 All projects have feasibility risks
o Our goal is to know the risks we face and the significance of those risks
o Project Sponsor, Project Manager, and other team members need this
awareness
o Once risks are known, steps can be taken to mitigate the risks
▪ For example, if unfamiliar with a new technology
```
- Provide enough budget for training
- Provide enough budget to hire consultants with expertise
- Allow more schedule time to move up the learning curve
- Use a methodology that incorporates experimentation


## Feasibility Assessment: Summing It Up

######  Essential to continuously review and revise the

###### feasibility assessment

```
o How well are we managing the risks we previously identified?
Are adjustments needed?
▪ Risk is being managed
▪ Risk is not well managed and needs further attention
o Are there any new risks that have appeared?
▪ If so, what are the actions needed to address those risks?
▪ Budgetary and schedule effect?

## Project Manager’s Balancing Act

#### Project Management

#### involves making trade-

#### offs...

#### Modifying one element

#### requires adjusting the others

```
Project Size
```

## Project Estimation

```
 The process of assigning projected values for time and effort
 Sources of estimates
oMethodology in use
oActual previous projects
oExperienced developers
 Estimates begin as a range and become more specific as the
project progresses
oIndustry standards
oFunction point estimation (Appendix 2A)
```

## Project Estimates Using Industry

## Standard Percentages

INDUSTRY STANDARD PERCENTAGES EXAMPLE
IF 4 months are required for Planning, then
15% X = 4, where X = overall length of project
X = 4 / 15%
X = 26.66 months for entire project
Therefore:◦ Planning (15%): 4 months
◦◦ Analysis (20%): Design (35%): 5.33 9.33 monthsmonths
◦ Implementation (30%): 8 months
◦ Total Project Length: 26.66 months


## Identifying Tasks

 Use established guidelines – existing methodologies
 Use analogies – model previous projects’ task lists
 Top-down approach – break high level tasks into smaller, detailed
tasks
 Organize into work breakdown structure


## Example – Determining Tasks using

## Top-down Approach

 Grade programming assignments
1.Create grading plan
A.Develop grading rubric
B.Develop test plan, test data, and check figures
2.Prepare programming projects for grading
A.Download submitted projects
B.For all projects, extract zipped files
3.For all projects,
A.Administer test plan and check performance and results
B.Check code for required elements
C.Apply rubric and determine final score.


### Typical

### Workplan Entry


## Project Work Plan


## Project Work Plan


## Staffing Considerations

 Match skills to project needs whenever possible
 Consider technical skills and interpersonal skills
oAll IS work is done in teams
oTechnical skills are not sufficient – need to be able to
work with others
oUse training and outside sources (consultants, vendor
support) when skills are not readily available
 Staffing levels will change over a project’s lifetime
 Adding staff adds overhead; not always productive


## Motivation

 Use monetary rewards cautiously
 Use intrinsic rewards
oRecognition
oAchievement
oThe work itself
oResponsibility
oAdvancement
oChance to learn new skills


## Motivation

 Consider the “de-motivators” ... DO NOT
oAssign unrealistic deadlines
oIgnore good efforts
oAccept a low-quality product
oGive everyone on the project the same raise
oMake an important decision without the team’s input
oMaintain poor working conditions


## Assuring Group Performance

 Make sure team understands the project and its goals
 Establish operating procedures (Project Charter)
oAvailability
oStatus reporting
oMeetings
 Ensure that team members get to know each other
 Establish methods for dealing with problems


## Project Estimates Require Refinement

```
oEven projects with high-quality
estimates will need refinement
oProject managers must adjust
estimated time throughout the
project
```

## Managing Scope

 Beware of scope creep
 Use JAD and prototyping to minimize scope creep pressure
 Implement formal change approval process
 Defer additional requirements as future system enhancements


## Timeboxing

 Time estimating techniques may reveal that the project requires
more time than we have available
 Timeboxing helps in these situations
oSet a tight but realistic deadline. Identify core, essential functional
requirements
oTeam limits its focus just to essential functions
oHigh quality is stressed
oOther functions will be added later
oRepeat to add refinements and enhancements


## When a Target Date is Missed...

 Don’t assume you can catch up
 The ONLY situation in which you can make up time is when:
oThe remainder of the project is simpler than the part you fell behind on, and
oThe remainder of the project is simpler than you expected when the original
estimates were made.
 Evaluate the complexity of the remainder of the project to
determine the correct schedule adjustment.
 Adding people is not always the right way to handle schedule
slippages.
