* Operating system: Software that manages a computer's hardware.
* Hardware: The central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/ouput (I/O) devices.
* Application programs: Such as word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers, define the ways in which these resources are used.
* Four components of a computer system: Hardware, Operating system, application programs, and user.
* Ease of use: How easily the operating system is to use for the end user.
* Resource utilization: how various hardware and software resources are shared.
* Touch screen: A system where the user interacts by pressing and swiping fingers acreoss the screen.
* Voice Recognition: A system that allows interaction by recongnising a users voice.
* Siri: Apple Inc's voice recognition software.
* Embedded computers: Computers with little or no user view, part of a system like home devices and automobiles.
* Resource allocator: An operating system manages avalible resources.
* Control program: Manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use.
* Moore's Law: Predicts that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every 18 months.
* Kernel: One program that is always running on the computer, base of the operating system.
* System Programs: Associated with the operating system, but not part of the kernel.
* Middleware: A set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers.
