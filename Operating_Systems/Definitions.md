# Chapter 1
* Operating system: Software that manages a computer's hardware.
* Hardware: The central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/ouput (I/O) devices.
* Application programs: Such as word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers, define the ways in which these resources are used.
* Four components of a computer system: Hardware, Operating system, application programs, and user.
* Ease of use: How easily the operating system is to use for the end user.
* Resource utilization: how various hardware and software resources are shared.
* Touch screen: A system where the user interacts by pressing and swiping fingers acreoss the screen.
* Voice Recognition: A system that allows interaction by recongnising a users voice.
* Siri: Apple Inc's voice recognition software.
* Embedded computers: Computers with little or no user view, part of a system like home devices and automobiles.
* Resource allocator: An operating system manages avalible resources.
* Control program: Manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use.
* Moore's Law: Predicts that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every 18 months.
* Kernel: One program that is always running on the computer, base of the operating system.
* System Programs: Associated with the operating system, but not part of the kernel.
* Middleware: A set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers.
* Interrupt: A signal sent to the CPU that my stop the system bus, usually at the completion of a program.
* Interrupt vector: An array of addresses that hold the interrupt service routines indexed by a unique number.
* Interrupt-request line: A wire on the CPU that is checked after executing every instruction.
* Interrupt-handler routine: The instruction set that the CPU jumps to after reading the interrupt number.
* Random-access memory (RAM): Rewritable memory that computers run programs off of. Also called main memory.
* Bit: A bit is the building block of computer storage and can be either 0 or 1.
* Byte: 8 bits, most common size of data to manipulate.
* Word: Number of bytes dependent on computer architecture. On a 64-bit computer, a word is 64 bits or 8 bytes.
* Secondary storage: An extention of main memory (RAM), able to hold data permanently.
* Hard-disk drives (HDDs): Spinning discs that are encoded with information, think CDs or DVDs.
* Nonvolatile memory (NVM): Circits that store data, generally called SSDs, think flash drives.
* Tertiary storage: Data storage used for special purposes like backup. Could be stored on optical disk or magnetic tape.
* Memory: In this book, volatile storage is referred to as memory. 
* Nonvolatile storage (NVS): It retains its contents when power is lost, usually secondary storage.
* Mechanical storage: HDDS, optical disks, etc. (generally larger and less expensive per byte)
* Electrical storage (NVM) : Flash memory, FRAM, NRAM, and SSD.
* **CPU: The hardware that executes instructions.**
* **Processor: A physical chip that contains one or more CPUs.**
* **Core: The basic computation unit of the CPU.**
* **Multicore: Including multiple computing cores on the same CPU.**
* **Multiprocessor: Including multiple processors.**
* Clustered system: A system which combines multiple CPUS.
* Loosely coupled: Clustered systems are considered loosely coupled because theay are composed of two  or more individual systems.
* High-availability service: Service that will continue evein if one or more failures occur.
* Graceful degradation: The ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware after a failure.
* Fault tolerant: Goes beyond graceful degradation because any single component can fail without affecting operations.
* Asymmetric clustering: One machine is in hot-standby mode where it is ready to jump in if the other machine fails.
* Symmetric clustering: Two or more machines are running programs and monitoring each other. 
* Parallelization: Dividing a program into sepate parts that run in parallel on different cores of the computer.
* Distributed lock manager (DLM): Access controal and locking for parallelization.
* Storage-area networks (SANs): Allow many systems to attach to a pool of storage.
* System daemons: System services that are loaded at boot and run the entire time the kernel is running.
* Trap (exception): Another form of an interrupt which is a software-generated kind caused by and error or a specific request.

* Process
* Multitasking: an extension of multiprogramming wherein CPU scheduling algorithms rapidly switch between processes
