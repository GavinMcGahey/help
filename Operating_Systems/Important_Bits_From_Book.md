* WHY STUDY OPERATING SYSTEMS?

Although there are many practitioners of computer science, only a small percentage of them will be involved in the creation or modification of an operating system. Why, then, study operating systems and how they work? Simply because, as almost all code runs on top of an operating system, knowledge of how operating systems work is crucial to proper, efficient, effective, and secure programming. Understanding the fundamentals of operating systems, how they drive computer hardware, and what they provide to applications is not only essential to those who program them but also highly useful to those who write programs on them and use them.
